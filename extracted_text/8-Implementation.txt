REQUIREMENTS
IMPLEMENTATION

PART ONE: REQUIREMENT PROCESS IMPROVEMENT
(CH31)

WHY IMPROVE?
• Improvement is about problem-solving. if the current requirement process seems to work well, there 
is no need to do so. Do not waste your time.
• If there were problems, then, ”learn from lessons” does make sense. It will allow you to be able to
• Recall how the problems were encountered on current/previous projects (overtime, over budget, 
a lots last-minute changes, a lots of rework, etc.)
• Figure out how the problems were corrected (good practice)
• Anticipate and hence prevent problems that you might encounter on future projects (find causes 
first).
• Adopt good practices that are more efficient and effective than those that are used in the 
previous projects, or try different practices.
• Improvement in requirement process will benefit all other parts of SDLC and stakeholders, because 
requirement process is related to other processes of software development projects and to all 
stakeholders.
• It could also have side effects on other project processes/stakeholders.
• It requires support/commitment from all parties, especially from ….


WHY: FROM PERSPECTIVE OF 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PARTS OF A PROJECT
Background
• Semantic network represents knowledge and belongs to AI. It shows knowledge about objects and 
the relationship between objects known as semantic relations, in the format of network.
• Example: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computerscience/semantic-network


WHY: FROM PERSPECTIVE OF 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PARTS OF A PROJECT
• Project planning: Requirements serve as the 
foundation of the project planning process. Based 
on the requirements, the planners select an 
appropriate software development life cycle and 
create resource and schedule estimates. Project 
planning also indicate some features may not be 
possible to deliver within the available bounds of 
resources and time. The planning process can 
lead to reductions in the project scope.
• Project tracking and control: Project tracking 
includes monitoring the project’s status against 
requirements’ status (refer to requirement status 
tracking).
• Change control: All subsequent changes and 
additions should be made through a defined 
change control process. Accepted changes will be 
added to the list of requirements.


WHY: FROM PERSPECTIVE OF 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PARTS OF A PROJECT
• Acceptance and system testing: User 
requirements and functional requirements are 
essential inputs to acceptance testing and system 
testing, respectively. The later informs 
requirement process on whether a requirement is 
verified or not.
• Construction: Requirements are the basis for the 
design and implementation work. 
Construction/development (or say design and 
coding) implements requirements.
• User documentation: The product’s requirements 
provide input to the user documentation such as 
user manual. 


HOW TO IMPROVE? -- RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Contributions or inputs from different stakeholders 
to requirements
There is a need to secure commitment from 
stakeholders to the improvement, in 
particular, the management of all 
stakeholders’ organisation.
Resistance:
• People who are already too busy to get 
their project work done.
• An improved new process might be 
viewed as a barrier to make changes 
harder to make (don’t bother, too much 
troubles.).
• Developers/managers view writing and 
reviewing requirements as bureaucratic 
time-wasters.

HOW TO IMPROVE? -- RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS
This scenario shows some real concerns
Everyone agreed that the last few projects had not gone smoothly. As the lead business analyst, Joanne 
knew that requirements issues had caused at least some of the problems. The BAs on the various 
projects varied greatly in their education and experience levels. They each used different approaches for 
developing and managing requirements, just doing the best they could based on what they knew. They 
each organized their requirements in different ways. Some teams followed effective requirements 
change processes, which reduced the turmoil in their projects, whereas others reacted to every change 
request that came along in a knee-jerk fashion. The frustration level was high all around.
Joanne had tried mentoring her less experienced BAs; some were more receptive to her input than 
others. Some of the teams in Joanne’s organization did do a good job on their requirements, and those 
projects suffered fewer headaches than those of the other teams. Joanne realized that it would be great 
to bring all of the teams up to a higher level of requirements performance. Maybe now the time was 
right to get serious about improving their requirements practices. But would the other BAs and their 
fellow team members play along? Was management truly committed to reducing the pain points? 
Would anything really change this time, or would this improvement initiative founder on the rocks of 
indifference, as the earlier ones had?

HOW TO IMPROVE? -- RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Commitment from management is the key
• Signs of having their support:


HOW TO IMPROVE? -- IMPROVEMENT PRINCIPLES
• Process improvement should be evolutionary and continuous
• People and organisations make improvements only when they have an incentive to do so
• Project missed deadlines because requirements were more extensive than expected.
• Developers worked a lot of overtime because of misunderstood or ambiguous requirements.
• System test effort was wasted because testers didn’t understand what the product was supposed to do.
• The right functionality was present, but users were dissatisfied because of sluggish performance, poor 
usability, or other quality shortcomings.
• The company experienced high maintenance costs because customers requested many enhancements that 
could have been identified during requirements elicitation.
• Requirement changes weren’t implemented appropriately during the course of the project, so the delivered 
solution did not meet the customer needs.
• Edits to requirements were lost or overwritten because multiple BAs were working on them concurrently 
without a version control process.
• Customers were not available to clarify and flesh out requirements.
• Requirements-related issues were not resolved in a timely fashion, causing rework.
• Process improvements should be goal-oriented
• Treat your improvement activities as mini-projects

HOW TO IMPROVE? -- IMPROVEMENT PROCESS CYCLE
• Step 1: assess the current practices
• Root-cause analysis (fishbone analysis) -- Root 
cause analysis involves asking “why” the 
problem exists several times in succession, each 
time probing for the reason that underlies the 
answer to the previous “why” question. 
(problem and cause are two different things.)


HOW TO IMPROVE? -- IMPROVEMENT PROCESS CYCLE
• Step 2: Planning
• Draft an improvement proposal.
• Review and revise the proposal.
• Pilot the improvement actions in Project A.
• Revise the change and the actions based on 
feedback from the pilot.
• Evaluate problem-tracking tools, and select 
one to support the change control process.
• Procure the problem-tracking tool, and 
customize it to support the change control 
process.


HOW TO IMPROVE? -- IMPROVEMENT PROCESS CYCLE
• Step 3: implementing Pilot is a good idea.
• Select pilot participants who will give the 
new approaches a fair try and provide 
helpful feedback. These participants could 
be either allies or sceptics but shouldn’t 
strongly oppose the improvement effort.
• Quantify the criteria which the team will use 
to evaluate the pilot’s results.
• Identify the stakeholders who need to be 
informed about the pilot and why it is being 
performed.
• Consider piloting portions of the new 
processes on different projects. This 
engages more people in trying new 
approaches, which increases awareness, 
feedback, and buy-in.
• Roll out the new actions and tool to the 
company.


HOW TO IMPROVE? -- IMPROVEMENT PROCESS CYCLE
• Step 4: Evaluating
• A critical step is to assess whether the new 
processes are yielding the desired results.
• As part of the evaluation, ask pilot 
participants how they would feel if they had 
to go back to their former ways of working.
Cycle!!
This is not a linear process. It is an iterative process.
• Step 3 can lead to plan next improvement.
• Step 4 can cause improvements at all previous steps. 

PART TWO: MANAGING RISKS (CH32)

WHAT IS A RISK?
• The possibility of something bad happening 
(Cambridge dictionary)
• A risk is a condition that could cause some loss or 
otherwise threaten the success of a project.
• Risk and reward -- The risk-reward relationship is 
based on the concept that the higher the risk of loss of 
principal for an investment, the greater the potential 
reward of an increase in the principal or higher yield 
on the principal.
• In software engineering, risks can lead project failure.
• Award is simply the delivery of software products on 
time and within the budget, leading to a great profit.
• Node down risks in a logbook


RISK MANAGEMENT
Software risk management is a balance of risk and reward
Risk management process
• Step 1: Identify the Risk. uncover, recognize and describe risks that might affect your project or its 
outcomes.
• Step 2: Analyse the risk. determine the likelihood and consequence of each risk.
• Step 3: Evaluate or Rank the Risk. evaluate 
or rank the risk by determining the risk 
magnitude, which is the combination of 
likelihood and consequence.
• Step 4: Handle the Risk. assess the highest 
ranked risks and set out a plan to treat or 
modify these risks to achieve acceptable 
risk levels. (contingent plan and risk 
migration)
• Step 5: Monitor and Review the risk. take 
your Project Risk Register and use it to 
monitor, track and review risks

RISKS IN REQUIREMENT ENGINEERING
In requirements elicitation
• Scope creep
• Caused by – Stakeholders do not share their understandings on what the product is supposed to be 
and to do at the beginning of a project but gradually add them on.
• How to deal with – Develop product vision and project scope document and use it as the reference 
to interpret requirements, strictly follow CCB
• Expectation gap among stakeholders
• Caused by – Chaos in customer engagement
• How to handle – Identify a representative for each customer group and description of each use case 
in plain language
• Incompleteness and incorrectness of requirements specifications
• Caused by – Customers themselves are not clear about business objectives
• How to handle – Mapping user requirements with business objectives and having customers to 
decide acceptance criteria

• Caused by – Lack of communications and agreement on requirements
• How to handle – Focus on primary customer who are normally the users


RISKS IN REQUIREMENT ENGINEERING
In requirements elicitation (continue)
