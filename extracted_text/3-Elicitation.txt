REQUIREMENTS 
ELICITATION

REQUIREMENT ELICITATION
Concept  
• It is the process of identifying the needs and constraints of the various stakeholders for a 
software system by proactively taking actions
• Not the same as “collecting requirements.” 
• Not a simple matter of transcribing exactly what users say.
• It is a collaborative and analytical process that includes activities to activities to draw out , 
discover, extract, and define requirements
• Collaborative
• engage end users 
• use the vocabulary of the business domain instead of forcing customers to understand 
technical jargon (rather than assuming that all participants share the same definitions) 
• “walk through” the processes with users to make decisions about their work, and extract the 
underlying logic
• Try to understand something about clients
• Design questions to draw out responses
Elicit means evoke or draw out answer 
(or fact) from someone.
Collect means gather things together. 

REQUIREMENT ELICITATION
• Analytical
• Reasons for analysing or processing
• What they say may not be what they mean
• Ambiguity (one word with multiple meanings) and vagueness (not clearly defined)
• Inconsistency
• incompleteness
• Conflicting 
• Gather together ”data” (words/phrases/sentences/business stories/etc.)
• Discover hidden or missed data
• Extract information from data collected
• Define requirement as the process of turning information to knowledge
Exercise: The device tester shall allow the user to easily connect addition components, including a pulse 
generator, a voltmeter a capacitance metre and custom probe cards. This is a bad description of requirement 
because of ambiguous words “easily” and “including”. How can we make it a good description? 

ELICITATION PROCESS
“Make your mind” before starting
• Objectives and expected outcomes (what do you want to achieve?)
• Resources (people, documents, systems, etc.) (what are constraints?)
• Timeline (when to do?)
• Techniques/methods (same or different techniques for each stakeholder group, single or 
combined techniques) (how to do?)


PREPARING ELICITATION
Preparation
• “Sessions” – you work on a session-basis if you divide stakeholders into several groups and elicit 
requirements for a group at a time.
• Learn about stakeholders to define groups and hence sessions – Have a background study on all 
relevant stakeholders, including culture, geographic location, role, and all tiny details and classify 
them into groups
• Session scope and agenda – decide step by step what to do according to information expected to 
have and time
• Prepare resources – physical resources such as room, computer, etc. and documents needed, as 
well as training (yourself) for online tools
• Prepare questions (related to objectives and outcomes)
• Imagine yourself learning the user’s job, or actually do the job under the user’s supervision. 
What tasks would you perform? What questions would you have?
• Straw man models – brainstorming-like approach to discussing any deficiencies that may 
lead to problems., “What else could …,” “What happens when …,” “Would you ever need to 
…” (You draft a proposal for others to criticise and then you develop a better one). 


PREPARING ELICITATION
Straw-man proposal
• You create an imperfect proposal 
• Everyone criticises (or questions or gives constructive comments on) it (so your proposal is a 
strawman, i.e. a target so the rest to attack)
• You then collect all criticism and build up a better proposal (for being criticised/attacked  
further)
Straw-man approach is actually similar to 
“抛砖引玉”in Chinese。

PERFORM ELICITATION
Perform
• Elicitation techniques/methods
• Interview – the most commonly used tech for collection and discovering
• Establish rapport – a close and harmonious relationship in which the people or groups 
concerned understand each other's feelings or ideas and communicate well
• Stay in scope – keep questions focusing on objectives
• Prepare questions beforehand
• Iterative rather than linear (some questions may not be easy to answer)
• Suggest ideas – suggest interviewees alternative ways to represent themselves if the BA 
identifies uncertainties in their sentences
• Listen actively – find uncertainties for further questions 
     to clarification


PERFORM ELICITATION
• Workshops encourage stakeholder collaboration in defining requirements
• Establish and enforce ground rules – starting/ending time, returning from breaks, switch off 
mobile phones, hold one conversation at a time, etc.
• Fill all the team roles – note taking, time keeping, ground rules implementing, all being 
heard, scope managing, etc.
• Plan an agenda – who leads what and when
• Stay in scope – keep right level of abstraction to avoid spending too much time and efforts in 
details. Referring business requirements to avoid project creed.
• Use flipchart to capture random information for later consideration
• Timebox discussion – allocate and keep time for each topic
• Keep the team small but include the right stakeholders
• Keep everyone engage (organisation skills)


PERFORM ELICITATION
• Focus groups -- A focus group is a representative group of users who generates input and ideas on a 
product’s functional and quality requirements. Focus groups are useful for exploring users’ attitudes, 
impressions, preferences, and needs
• Deal with conflicts
• select the focus group members carefully
• keep them on topic, but without influencing the opinions being expressed
• Observations (when users confused themselves, less cooperative, not be able to represent clearly, ... )
• Pros: allows the BA to 
• validate information collected from other 
    sources
• identify new topics for interviews
• see problems with the current system
• identify ways that the new system can better 
    support the workflow
• Cons: time consuming


PERFORM ELICITATION
• Questionnaires are a way to survey large groups of users to understand their needs
• Tips of well-written questions
• Provide answer options that cover the full set of possible responses.
• Make answer choices both mutually exclusive (no overlaps in numerical ranges) and 
exhaustive (list all possible choices and/or have a write-in spot for a choice you 
     didn’t think of).
• Don’t phrase a question in a way that implies a “correct” answer.
• If you use scales, use them consistently throughout the questionnaire.
• Use closed questions with two or more specific choices if you want to use the questionnaire 
results for statistical analysis. (Also save users’ time.) Open-ended questions allows users to 
respond any way they want, so it’s hard to look for commonalities in the results.
• Consider consulting with an expert in questionnaire design and administration to ensure that 
you ask the right questions of the right people.
• Always test a questionnaire before distributing it. It’s frustrating to discover too late that a 
question was phrased ambiguously or to realize that an important question was omitted.
• Don’t ask too many questions or people won’t respond.


PERFORM ELICITATION
• Legacy system analysis
• System interface analysis -- revealing functional requirements regarding the exchange of 
data and services between systems
• User interface analysis -- study existing systems to discover user and functional requirements
• Document analysis -- examining any existing documentation for potential software 
requirements
• Techniques by project characteristic
    (See the diagram)
• Some tips
• Educate stakeholders
• Take good note
• Exploit the physical space


FOLLOW UP ACTIVITIES
Follow up
•  First block aims to identify missing information.
• Organising notes – to find out any missed information because you did not write down 
(during interview, for example, due to lack of time), according to your memory, also to 
classify data/information and arrange them in logical ways
• Sharing notes – to interviewees to confirm what you noted is what you said
• Second aims to decide any area you need to further explore, i.e. to organise further events to 
clarify and to know more.  
• NOTE: the key is to keep the true stories as customers said, so do not edit the notes according 
your understanding. If you want to edit, keep the original notes in a “safe” place as you may need 
to refer to it later. 


CLASSIFICATION OF USERS’ POINTS
Classifying customers’ input
• Filter out the followings first:
• A project requirement that is not related to the software development, such as the need to 
train users on the new system.
• A project constraint, such as a cost or schedule restriction (as opposed to the design or 
implementation constraints).
• An assumption or a dependency.
• Additional information of a historical, context-setting, or descriptive nature.
• Extraneous information that does not add value.

CLASSIFICATION OF USERS’ POINTS
• Then classify the rest into the following 
nine categories: 
• Business requirements Anything that 
describes the financial, marketplace, 
or other business benefit that either 
customers or the developing 
organization wish to gain from the 
product is a business requirement
• Increase market share in region 
X by Y percent within Z months.
• Save X per year on electricity 
now wasted by inefficient units.


CLASSIFICATION OF USERS’ POINTS
• User requirements are the user goals or business tasks that users need to perform, most typically 
represented as use cases, scenarios, or user stories
• I need to print a mailing label for a package.
• As the lead machine operator, I need to calibrate the pump controller first thing every 
morning.
• (Remember unambiguity, completeness, level of details)
• Business rules describe only activities only certain users can perform
• A unconditional offer requires the applicant to present ATAS and to pay 60% of his tuition fee 
in advance.
• Time-off approvals must comply with the company’s HR vacation policy.
• Functional requirements describe the observable behaviours the system will exhibit under 
certain conditions and the actions the system will let users take
• If anyone entered the laser lab, the laser on warning light should come on.
• The user must be able to sort the project list in forward and reverse alphabetical order.

CLASSIFICATION OF USERS’ POINTS
• Quality attributes describe how well the system does something
• The mobile software must respond quickly to touch commands.
• The shopping cart mechanism has to be simple to use so my new customers don’t abandon the 
purchase.
• External interface requirements describe the connections between your system and the rest of the 
universe.
• The manufacturing execution system must control the wafer sorter.
• The mobile app should send the check image to the bank after I photograph the check I’m 
depositing.
• Constraints legitimately restrict the options available to the developer
• Data requirements Customers are presenting a data requirement whenever they describe the format, 
data type, allowed values, or default value for a data element; the composition of a complex business 
data structure; or a report to be generated
• Date is presented with the format of dd/mm/yyyy.
• An order consists of the customer’s identity, shipping information, and one or more products, 
each of which includes the product number, number of units, unit price, and total price

CLASSIFICATION OF USERS’ POINTS
• Solution ideas: Many “requirements” from users are really 
solution ideas. Someone who describes a specific way to interact 
with the system to perform some action is suggesting a solution. 
Examples:
• Then I select the drop-off station where I want to have my 
order received from a drop-down list.
• The smart phone has to allow the user to swipe with a finger 
to navigate between screens.


COMPLETION
• When one or more of the followings are reached
• The users can’t think of any more use cases or user stories. Users tend to identify user 
requirements in sequence of decreasing importance.
• Users propose new scenarios, but they don’t lead to any new functional requirements. A 
“new” use case might really be an alternative flow for a use case you’ve already captured.
• Users repeat issues they already covered in previous discussions.
• Suggested new features, user requirements, or functional requirements are all deemed to be 
out of scope.
• Proposed new requirements are all low priority.
• The users are proposing capabilities that might be included “sometime in the lifetime of the 
product” rather than “in the specific product we’re talking about right now.”
• Developers and testers who review the requirements for an area raise few questions.
