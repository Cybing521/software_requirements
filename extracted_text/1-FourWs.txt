FOUR Ws

PART ONE: WHAT (CH1)

WHAT ARE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
• Terms: user requirement, software 
requirement, business 
requirement, functional 
requirement, system requirement, 
product requirement, project 
requirement, user story, feature,  
constraint, etc. 
• Definition: Requirements are asset 
of specifications of what should be 
implemented. They are descriptions 
of how the system should behave, 
or about system properties or 
attributes. They may be a 
constraint on the development 
process of the system.
• Types of requirements (see the list)
Term DefinitionProvides end-to-end IT solutions, Network 
Support 
Business requirement A high-level business objective of the organisation that builds a product or 
of a customer who procures it.
Business rule A policy, guideline, standard, or regulation that defines or constrains some 
aspect of the business. Not a software requirement in itself, but the origin 
of several types of software requirements.
Constraint A restriction that is imposed on the choices available to the developer for 
the design and construction of a product.
External interface 
requirement
A description of a connection between a software system and a user, 
another software system, or a hardware device.
Feature One or more logically related system capabilities that provide value to a 
user and are described by a set of functional requirements.
Functional requirement A description of a behaviour that a system will exhibit under specific 
conditions.
Nonfunctional 
requirement
A description of a property or characteristic that a system must exhibit or a 
constraint that it must respect.
Quality attribute A kind of non-functional requirement that describes a service or 
performance characteristic of a product.
System requirement A top-level requirement for a product that contains multiple subsystems, 
which could be all software or software and hardware.
User requirement A goal or task that specific classes of users must be able to perform with a 
system, or a desired product attribute.
Users (or end users) are the 
ones who will use the 
software system.

WHAT ARE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
Software requirements include three distinct levels: business requirements, user requirements, 
and functional requirements
• Top level: Vision and scope – business 
objectives and expected benefit, giving the 
reasons for developing the software (why)
• 2nd level: User requirements – tasks to 
perform and software attributes and 
characteristics (what)
• 3rd level: Software specification -- 
• Functional requirements – system’s 
behaviours
• Systems requirements – structure of the 
system
• External interface – connections to other 
systems
• Constraints – what developers can do 
and what cannot
Example: London Ambulance Service (LAS) Computer-Aided 
Dispatching System (CAD) is provided in the handout. It explains 
some types of requirements.  

WHAT ARE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
Example: University of London is now an umbrella of a number of “small” universities in London. 
One of these small-size universities has been updating its student management system 
(basically a data system consisting of databases and reporting tools) from Agresso to SITS.
• Business requirements – solving all problems of Agresso (The two systems have the similar 
functionalities and Agresso fits smaller universities. Agresso’s functionalities were not 
demonstrated because of the so-called IT personnel do not really understand the business 
rules of admissions, registry, academics etc.) Reducing human errors in student management 
by automating the process
• User requirements – the requirements from staff who use the system, including admissions, 
registry, admin of academic departments, academics, etc.
• System specification or functionalities – students’ profiles creation and maintenance , 
creating modules of each semester for every students, students’ mark publishing, 
progression, awards (1st, 2nd upper, 2nd lower, 3rd, and no award), timetables, GUI, etc. 
• Constraints – GDPR, security, access, EDI, etc. 

WHAT ARE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
Two different scenarios (business models):
• A software firm to develop software for clients (Some software firms have their own expert 
areas and they develop software of the expert areas for their clients.)
• Manager, marketing personnel and users are all on client side
• BA is the interface between the firm and its clients
• Example: excoms is an SME Provides end-to-end IT solutions, computer network support, 
cybersecurity solutions. 
• A software firm to customise their products to fit their clients’ specific needs
• BA is a bridge connecting CEO level of the firms and the development team. 
• It is also the interface between the customers and the development team. 
• Example: Grassroots was a software company. Its main product was a project 
management software designed based on the company’s philosophy of project 
management. So, it does not only sell its product, but also its management philosophy. 

CW TASKS 1, 2
CW contains a series tasks on a 
group work basis. 
• Tasks 1 to 3:
• Grouping with group 
members,  a leader and a 
agreed scenario
• Detailed description of the 
project/scenario  agreed

PART TWO: WHY (CHS1 AND 2)

WHY ARE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS IMPORTANT?
• Various studies suggest that errors introduced during requirements activities count for 40 to 50 
percent of all defects found in a software product. (negative impacts can be found in: 
https://www.tricentis.com/blog/real-life-examples-of-software-development-failures/)


WHY ARE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS IMPORTANT?
• Rework often consumes 30 to 50 percent of total development cost, and requirements errors can 
count for 70 to 85 percent of the rework cost
• Reasons for poor software requirements
• Insufficient user involvement (This is also addressed in Agile)
• Inaccurate planning (https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/329019)
• Creeping user requirements (creeping means enlarge without being noticed.)
• Ambiguous requirements (e.g. user friendly is not tangible and measurable)
• Gold plating (meaning any expensive nonessential item, convenience, or features)
• Overlooked stakeholders (Someone who received little attention. Who will be that 
”someone” in your experience? )

Benefits from a high-quality requirements 
process
• Fewer defects in requirements and in the 
delivered product.
• Reduced development rework.
• Faster development and delivery.
• Fewer unnecessary and unused features.
• Lower enhancement costs.
• Fewer miscommunications.
• Reduced scope creep.
• Reduced project chaos.
• Higher customer and team member 
satisfaction.
• Products that do what they’re supposed to do.
Four principles of high-quality requirements
https://seilevel.com/requirements/the-four-attributes-of-
high-quality-requirements (Requirement Blog)
1. Atomic/ specific
An atom is the “smallest indivisible unit of matter that retains 
the properties of an element.”
2. Unambiguous
When two different people claim they understand the same 
requirement, they can have two different interpretations of 
what is being stated.
3 Testable/measurable
The requirement must provide a way to determine if the 
software built is sufficient. There must be a finite point 
distinguishing between passing and failing.
4. Necessary
If you ask the stakeholder, every requirement will probably be 
“necessary”.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS 
PERSPECTIVE
A stakeholder is a person, group, or organisation that 
is actively involved in a project, is affected by its 
process or outcome, or can influence its process or 
outcome.
Stake – wooden pole driven into ground to mark 
boundary.
Stakeholder – people who hold the stake when it is 
driven into ground, i.e. people who decide where to 
place the stake because of their own interests.


CW TASK 3
• Task 3:
• List of all stakeholders of your projects
• Explanations of the roles of the stakeholders would play 

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS 
PERSPECTIVE
Avoid overlooking some important community but focus on the core set whose input you really 
need, to make sure you understand all of the project’s requirements and constraints so your team 
can deliver the right solution 


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS 
PERSPECTIVE
Customers are a subset of stakeholders.
• A customer is an individual or organization that 
derives either direct or indirect benefit from a 
product. Software customers could request, pay for, 
select, specify, use, or receive the output generated 
by a software product.
• The customers include the direct user, indirect user, 
executive sponsor, procurement staff, and acquirer. 
• Some stakeholders are not customers, such as legal 
staff, compliance auditors, suppliers, contractors, and 
venture capitalists.
• End users are a subset of customers. 
• User requirements should come from the end user 
who will actually use the product, either directly or 
indirectly.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS 
PERSPECTIVE
Excellent requirements result from effective collaboration between developers and customers (in 
particular, actual users)—a partnership.
Discussion: 
Difference between teamwork, 
cooperation and collaboration? 

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FROM 
CUSTOMERS PERSPECTIVE
Legal reasons (in the USA)
Requirements Bill of Rights for Software Customers
You have the right to
1. Expect BAs to speak your language.
2. Expect BAs to learn about your business and your objectives.
3. Expect BAs to record requirements in an appropriate form.
4. Receive explanations of requirements practices and deliverables.
5. Change your requirements.
6. Expect an environment of mutual respect.
7. Hear ideas and alternatives for your requirements and for their 
solution.
8. Describe characteristics that will make the product easy to use.
9. Hear about ways to adjust requirements to accelerate development 
through reuse.
10. Receive a system that meets your functional needs and quality 
expectations.
Requirements Bill of Responsibilities for Software Customers
You have the responsibility to
1. Educate BAs and developers about your business.
2. Dedicate the time that it takes to provide and clarify 
requirements.
3. Be specific and precise when providing input about requirements.
4. Make timely decisions about requirements when asked.
5. Respect a developer’s assessment of the cost and feasibility of 
requirements.
6. Set realistic requirement priorities in collaboration with 
developers.
7. Review requirements and evaluate prototypes.
8. Establish acceptance criteria.
9. Promptly communicate changes to the requirements.
10. Respect the requirements development process. 


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FROM 
CUSTOMERS PERSPECTIVE
Decision making with the development team
• There can be hundreds of decisions to make on software projects; often, they are on the critical 
path to being able to move ahead. You might need to resolve some conflict, accept (or reject) a 
proposed change, or approve a set of requirements for a specific release.
•  Agreement between development and customers
• Reaching agreement on the requirements for the product to be built, or for a specific portion 
of it, is at the core of the customer-developer partnership. Multiple parties are involved in 
this agreement:
• Customers agree that the requirements address their needs.
• Developers agree that they understand the requirements and that the requirements are 
feasible (doable, achievable).
• Testers agree that the requirements are verifiable.
• Management (from customer side) agrees that the requirements will achieve their 
business objectives.


CW TASK 4
• To identify requirements for all different types from all stakeholders
• To classify the requirements
• To explain the requirements and types. 

PART THREE: HOW (CH3)

HOW TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
Software requirements development process 
Four iterative, interwoven and incremental phases OR, 17 steps


HOW TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
Elicitation encompasses all of the activities involved with discovering requirements starting from 
the top level. The activities can be interviews, workshops, document analysis, prototyping, and 
others, aiming to:
Example of identifying “other stakeholders”
Think about: whether would staff in Finance 
department use SITS? 
They do as they need to record students’ fee 
situation. 
• Identify the product’s expected user classes and other 
stakeholders (from whom the requirements should 
come from)
(This diagram is not a good one. 
Requirement engineering also include 
requirement implementation.) 

HOW TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
• Understanding user tasks and goals, and the business objectives with which those tasks align. 
Not all tasks taken by users is relevant to need for the systems and some can be irrelevant. (what 
the requirements are about and why)
• Learn about the environment in which the new product will be used (conditions)
• Understand functionality needs and their quality expectations of each user class. (functional and 
non-functional requirements)
Example of “irrelevant task”
Think about: whether would recording external examiners’ comments be related to 
the use of SITS? 
No, as the comments has nothing to do with the students.
Example of “environment” (may not necessarily be physical environment)
Think about: what would the admin’s IT skills be regarding SITS 
development? 

HOW TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
Analysing requirements leads requirement progression from one level to another
• It is a process having the requirements as the raw material inputs and a richer and more precise 
understanding of each requirement as the outputs. 
• Analysis activities:
• Analysing the information received from users to distinguish their task goals from 
functional requirements, quality expectations, business rules, suggested solutions, and 
other information
• Decomposing high-level requirements into an appropriate level of detail
• Deriving functional requirements from other requirements information 
• Understanding the relative importance of quality attributes
• Allocating requirements to software components defined in the system architecture (which 
can be the case in the second type scenario where product is already developed)
• Negotiating implementation priorities (you know this is important in Agile)
• Identifying gaps in requirements or unnecessary requirements as they relate to the defined 
scope

HOW TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
Requirements specification involves representing and storing the collected requirements 
knowledge in a persistent and well-organised fashion. The principal activity is:
“Translating the collected user needs into written requirements and diagrams suitable for 
comprehension, review, and use by their intended audiences.”
• This is a “house keeping” task and it is a good habit. It helps to find the related items when we 
need them in the later stages of software development.
• This is equivalent to data pre-processing in ML 
• Sorting is very important (classification + sorting according to importance).

3 3 3 3 3
8 8 8 8 5
1 5 5 5 8
What is the algorithm 
used? Can you 
implement? 


HOW TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS?
Requirements validation confirms that you have the correct set of requirements information that 
will enable developers to build a solution that satisfies the business objectives. The central activities 
are:
• Reviewing the documented requirements to correct any errors/mistakes or anything you are  not 
very clear about before the development group accepts them.
• Developing acceptance tests and criteria to confirm that a product based on the requirements 
would meet customer needs and achieve the business objectives. (You must know acceptance 
tests used in Agile. An acceptance test is of the format of “black-box” test, i.e. you feed with 
inputs and check whether the output is the one you expected, known as validation.) 

GOOD PRACTICES
In the four phases
• Elicitation
• Define vision and scope
• Identify user classes (according the way they would use the software)
• Select product champions (key contact person for each class)
• Conduct focus groups
• Identify user requirements
• Identify system events and responses (to understand the relations between each items of 
requirements)
• Hold elicitation interviews (you have to be well-prepared)
• Hold facilitated elicitation workshops (like what I did for DPS)
• Observe users performing their jobs (Natural languages can be defective and unclear)
• Distribute questionnaires (ensure at least 30 to 40% back to you)
• Perform document analysis
• Examine problem reports
• Reuse existing requirements (if you could find one)


GOOD PRACTICES
• Analysis 
• Model the application environment
• Create prototypes
• Analyse feasibility
• Prioritise requirements
• Create a data dictionary
• Model the requirement (scenario-based modelling, data modelling, 
     flow-oriented modelling, class-based modelling 
     and behavioural modelling)
• Analyse interfaces (Between different sets of requirements)
• Allocate requirements to subsystem (This might be too early to do, 
     but you can classify requirements into different sets.)


GOOD PRACTICES
• Specification 
• Adopt requirement document templates (So requirements can be uniformed and more 
transparent)  
• Identify requirement origins (whether it comes from the end users or not)
• Uniquely label each requirement
• Record business rules
• Specify non-functional requirements
• Validation
• Review the requirements
• Test the requirements
• Define acceptance criteria
• Simulate the requirements with scenario-based modelling, data modelling,
    flow-oriented modelling, class-based modelling and behavioural modelling


GOOD PRACTICES
Good practices from other perspectives
Knowledge
• Train business analysts
• Educate stakeholders about 
requirements
• Educate developers about 
application domain
• Define a requirements 
engineering process

• Perform change impact analysis
• Establish baselines and control 
versions of requirements sets

GOOD PRACTICES
From other perspectives (continue)
Project management 
• Select an appropriate life cycle – which one is suitable for the entire project? 
• Plan requirements approach – how and when to start and continue requirements 
process?
• Estimate requirements effort – what HR needed?
• Project base plans on requirements – renew project base plans along with requirements
• Identify requirements decision makers – who decide?
• Renegotiate commitments – with customer when changes in requirements introduced
• Manage requirements risks – contingent plan for changing conditions/environments
• Track requirements effort – cannot spend endless efforts on requirements
• Review past lessons learned – to avoid the same mistakes

GOOD PRACTICES
Trade-off between value and difficulty
• High value (value of the good practices with respect to the benefit they can bring into 
requirement engineering process)

PART FOUR: WHO (CH4)

WHOSE JOB?
The ways to participate 
How various stakeholders might participate in eliciting the three levels 
of requirements?
• Manager (corporate roles) to produce business needs
• Marketing (commercial roles) to identify market opportunities
• Business analysts (BAs) and User representatives (Reps) are the key 
personnel to convert business requirements to user requirements
• Project manager is supposed 
• To work with user requirement, and 
• To produce functional requirement (BA and project manager)
• Developers and testers are to carry on in the line to work out system 
specifications


WHOSE JOB?
Business analyst (BA)
Role
• Responsibility to elicit, analyse, document, and validate the needs of the project stakeholders 
• Principal interpreter between customer community and the software development team


WHOSE JOB?
Business analyst’s tasks
Comprehensively understand applications and pass on the understanding to developers 
• Define business requirements – by BA himself or through BA to find some other people such as  
sponsor, product manager, or marketing manager, BA might suggest a template for a vision and 
scope document  
• Plan the requirements approach – plans to elicit, analyse, document, validate, and manage 
requirements throughout the project, BA works with project manager to ensure the plan align 
with overall project plan (Should this be scheduling rather than planning or not?)
• Identify project stakeholders and user classes – work with the business sponsors to select 
appropriate representatives for each user class, explain what BA would like to have from them 
and agree on an appropriate level of engagement from each one 
• Elicit requirement – by using a variety of information-gathering techniques 
• Analyse requirements – derived requirements as the logical consequence of what the customers 
requested by using requirements models to recognize patterns, to identify gaps in the 
requirements, to reveal conflicting requirements, and to confirm that all requirements scope 
Difference between planning and scheduling:
Planning is make a plan formed by a sequence of actions
Scheduling is to make a schedule formed with a sequence of 
action and associated with time.

WHOSE JOB?
BA’s tasks (continue)
• Document requirements – writing down requirements “to clearly describes the solution that will 
address the customer’s problem” (really?) by using standard templates 
• Communicate requirements – represent requirements by using methods other than text to 
ensure all parties to understand the information you are communicating (Key in communication 
is to let others to accept your idea rather than just to understand you.)
• Lead requirements validation -- ensuring all requirements are feasible, in scope, legal, etc. and 
setting up acceptance criteria for testing possible solutions
• Facilitate requirements prioritisation -- broker collaboration and negotiation among various 
stakeholders and the developers to ensure that they make sensible priority decisions 
• Management requirements -- track the status of those requirements, verify their satisfaction in 
the product, and manage changes to the requirements baseline (meaning essential and 
approved-by-all requirements)

WHOSE JOB?
Essential skills a BA needs
• Listening -- Active listening involves eliminating distractions, maintaining an attentive posture 
and eye contact, and restating key points to confirm your understanding 
• Interviewing and questioning -- interact with diverse individuals and groups  and ask the right 
questions 
• Thinking on your feet -- spot contradictions, uncertainty, vagueness, and assumptions so the 
issues can be discussed in the moment when they are discovered (uncertainties = vagueness, 
ambiguity, inaccuracy, un-specification, etc.)
• Analytical -- think at both high and low levels of abstraction and knows when to move from one 
to another, i.e. specifying and generalising
• System thinking -- see the big picture 
• Learning – life-long learner for new material quickly to develop background knowledge to carry 
on requirement engineering (background, really? Shall it be background of customer?)
• Facilitation – initiate and lead discussion
Thinking on your feet – you got an idea and you 
make a move based on the idea very quickly. 
Here, it means that you spot uncertainty quickly 
and take action to clarify it quickly. 

WHOSE JOB?
Essential skills a BA needs (continue)
• Leadership -- influence a group of stakeholders to move in a certain direction to accomplish a 
common goal based on the knowledge of various techniques
• Observational -- watching a user perform her job or use a current application helps to detect 
subtleties that the user might not think to mention 
• Communication -- express complex ideas clearly, both in written form and verbally for multiple 
audiences, including customers who have to validate the requirements and developers who need 
clear, precise requirements for implementation
• Organisational -- to set up an information architecture (classes, categories, etc) to support the 
project information as it grows throughout the project 
• Modelling -- structured analysis models (data flow diagram, entity-relationship diagram, and 
similar diagrams, Unified Modelling Language (UML) notations, etc
• Interpersonal -- get people with competing interests to work together as a team and speak the 
language of the audience she is talking to, not using technical teams with business stakeholders 
• Creativity – may offer new ideas (not solutions)

WHOSE JOB?
Essential analyst knowledge
Business analysts need a breadth of knowledge, much of which is gained through experience.
• understand contemporary requirements engineering practices and how to apply them in the 
context of various software development life cycles
• sound understanding of project management, development life cycles, risk management, and 
quality engineering
• product management concepts such as new product development, business justification, 
planning, verification, forecasting, pricing, product launch, and marketing of a product
• basic level of knowledge about the architecture and operating environment, so that they can 
engage in technical conversations about priorities and non-functional requirements.
• business, the industry, and the organization are powerful assets -- applications’ backgrounds 

WHOSE JOB?
Who are suitable to be a business analyst?
• The former user
• The former developer or tester
• The former (or concurrent) project manager
• The subject matter expert
• The rookie (new recruit) 
It is a higher ranking and rewarding job


PART FIVE: CASE STUDIES

1. THE NEED FOR SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
“Hello, Phil? This is Maria in Human Resources. We’re having a problem with the personnel system you programmed 
for us. An employee just changed her name to Sparkle Starlight, and we can’t get the system to accept the name 
change. Can you help?”
“She married some guy named Starlight?”
“No, she didn’t get married, just changed her name,” Maria replied. “That’s the problem. It looks like we can change 
a name only if someone’s marital status changes.”
“Well, yeah, I never thought someone might just change her name. I don’t remember you telling me about this 
possibility when we talked about the system,” Phil said.
“I assumed you knew that people could legally change their name anytime they like,” responded Maria. “We have to 
straighten this out by Friday or Sparkle won’t be able to cash her paycheck. Can you fix the bug by then?”
“It’s not a bug!” Phil retorted. “I never knew you needed this capability. I’m busy on the new performance evaluation 
system. I can probably fix it by the end of the month, but not by Friday. Sorry about that. Next time, tell me these 
things earlier and please write them down.”
“What am I supposed to tell Sparkle?” demanded Maria. “She’ll be upset if she can’t cash her check.”
“Hey, Maria, it’s not my fault,” Phil protested. “If you’d told me in the first place that you had to be able to change 
someone’s name at any time, this wouldn’t have happened. You can’t blame me for not reading your mind.”
Angry and resigned, Maria snapped, “Yeah, well, this is the kind of thing that makes me hate computers. Call me as 
soon as you get it fixed, will you?”

2. CUSTOMERS’ THOUGHTS ABOUT SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 
Gerhard, a senior manager at Contoso Pharmaceuticals, was meeting with Cynthia, the manager of Contoso’s IT 
department. “We need to build a chemical tracking information system,” Gerhard began. “The system should keep 
track of all the chemical containers we already have in the stockroom and in laboratories. That way, the chemists 
can get some chemicals from someone down the hall instead of always buying a new container. This should save 
us a lot of money. Also, the Health and Safety Department needs to generate government reports on chemical 
usage and disposal with a lot less work than it takes them today. Can you build this system in time for the 
compliance audit in five months?”
“I see why this project is important, Gerhard,” said Cynthia. “But before I can commit to a schedule, we’ll need to 
understand the requirements for the chemical tracking system.”
Gerhard was confused. “What do you mean? I just told you my requirements.”
“Actually, you described some general business objectives for the project,” Cynthia explained. “That doesn’t give 
me enough information to know what software to build or how long it might take. I’d like to have one of our 
business analysts work with some users to understand their needs for the system.”
“The chemists are busy people,” Gerhard protested. “They don’t have time to nail down every detail before you can 
start programming. Can’t your people figure out what to build?”
Cynthia replied, “If we just make our best guess at what the users need to do with the system, we can’t do a good 
job. We’re software developers, not chemists. I’ve learned that if we don’t take the time to understand the 
problem, nobody is happy with the results.”
“We don’t have time for all that,” Gerhard insisted. “I gave you my requirements. Now just build the system, 
please. Keep me posted on your progress.”

3. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS PROCESS
“Welcome to the group, Sarah,” said the project manager, Kristin. “We’re looking forward to having you help us 
with the requirements for this project. I understand that you were a business analyst in your previous job. Do 
you have some idea of how we should get started here?”
“Well,” Sarah replied, “I was thinking I should just interview some users and see what they want. Then I’ll write 
up what they tell me. That should give the developers a good place to start. That’s mostly what we did before. 
Do you know some users I could talk to?”
“Hmmm. Do you think that will be good enough for this type of project?” Kristin asked. “We tried that approach 
before, but it didn’t work out very well. I was hoping you might have some ideas about best practices from your 
past BA experiences that might be better than just interviewing a couple of users. Are there any particular 
techniques that you’ve found to be especially helpful?”
Sarah was rather at a loss. “I don’t really know about any specific ways to approach requirements other than 
talking to users and trying to write clear specifications from what they say. At my last job I just did the best I 
could based on my business experience. Let me see what I can find out.”
