REQUIREMENTS
MANAGEMENT

PART ONE: REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
(CH27)

TRUTH BEHIND STORY
Shari: “I finally finished implementing the multivendor catalogue query feature. That was a lot of work!”
Dave: “Oh, the customers cancelled that feature two weeks ago.”
S: “Didn’t you get the revised SRS? What do you mean, it was cancelled? Those requirements are at the 
top of page 6 of my latest SRS.”
D: “Hmmm, they’re not in my copy. I’ve got version 1.5 of the SRS. What version are you looking at?”
S: “Mine says version 1.5 also. These documents should be identical, but obviously they’re not. So, is this 
feature still needed, or did I just waste 30 hours of my life?”
This story tells the importance of requirement 
management and effective communication.
Having the well-presented meaningful requirements is 
only the halfway of SE
Version control is one of the important aspects of 
requirement management which is an element of 
requirement engineering. 
Change control is significantly serious in requirement 
engineering. 

REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Aiming to maintain the integrity, accuracy, and currency of requirements agreements throughout the 
project
Four aspects:
• Version control: to avoid different team members to use different requirements
• Change control: to handle changes on the 
requirements
• Requirements status tracking: to be aware of 
the current status of requirements 
(plus responsibilities to 
inform whomever to take actions)
• Requirements tracing: to monitor the 
impacts of a change to other elements 
within the same system or to other external 
systems.


REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT 
PROCESS
SRS Version control
• Version ID – e.g. v1.2, but my habit is Vddmmyy
• Accessibility – all team members use the same 
version
• Permission to updating – only designated persons can 
modify
• Version history – keep all previous versions
• Other attributes:
• Date the requirement was created
• Author who wrote the requirement
• Priority/Status/Origin or source of the requirement (refer to previous lectures about priority and 
origin – from which stakeholder)
• Rationale behind the requirement (what to achieve with the completement of the requirement)
• Release number or iteration to which the requirement is allocated (mid-term report, deliverable 
number. etc.)
• Stakeholders to contact with questions or to make decisions about changes (refer to source)
• Validation method to be used or acceptance criteria (formal or informal peer review?)


REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Change control
• Changes to be made only through the project’s defined change control procedure (more in Part 2)
• New or changed requirements can be accommodate in various ways:
• By deferring lower-priority requirements to later iterations or cutting them completely
• By obtaining additional staff or outsourcing some of the work
• By extending the delivery schedule or adding iterations to an agile project
• By sacrificing quality to ship by the original date
Change control in Agile 
• One of the manifestos of Agile software project management is to value Responding to changes over 
following a plan
• Together with other three
• Value Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
• Value Working software over comprehensive documentation
• Value Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Agile explains the reasons for changes as the followings:
• It is hard to have a long-term plan (actually schedule) for all tasks with the starting and the ending 
dates (in the form, e.g. Gantt chart) because
• Business process in customers’ organisations can change.
• Customers need time to clarify/confirm their requirements
• Developers’ understandings on tasks (e.g. whether they are still needed or some new tasks may 
appear, how complex they are, how long time the developers would need to complete them, 
etc.) change along the time.  
• The solution is to set up short-term plans, such as those that are set up for 2 weeks, can be more 
realistic. 
• Of course, teams will have to follow these short-term plans . By executing these short plans, 
developers will gain better understandings on the followed-up tasks and, hence, will be in better 
positions to develop the next bunch of short-term plans for the further development of the project 
they participate in. 

Portkin’s conceptual framework for change reduction
• Reduce change scope
• Time reduction: reducing the time from concepts to 
reproductivity, i.e. dividing project into modules as small as 
possible so the completion of one module will require less 
time and the change in one module will require less time to 
reproduce the module. 
• Place reduction:  dividing into isolated modules so that the 
module will be unlikely affected by changes introduced into 
others
• Join the change
• Diversity increase: producing large number of offspring to 
increase diversity so the chance that one individual would be 
able to face the change increases
• Knowledge gaining: intelligent mechanism being able to track 
the changes in the world and adapt the software itself.

REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS

REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Status tracking
• A requirement can have 9 status
• Update a requirement’s status only when specified transition conditions are satisfied
Status Definition
Proposed The requirement has been requested by an authorised source.
In Progress A BA is actively working on handling the requirement. Drafted The initial version of the requirement has been written.
Drafted The requirement has been analysed and specified.
Approved The requirement has been validated and it has been allocated to a specific release. The stakeholders have agreed to 
incorporate the requirement, and a development team has committed to implement it.
Implemented The code that implements the requirement has been designed, written, and unit tested. The requirement has been traced 
to the relevant design and code elements. The software that implements the requirement is now ready for testing, review.
Verified The requirement has satisfied its acceptance criteria, meaning that the correct functioning of the implemented 
requirement has been confirmed. The requirement has been traced to pertinent tests. It is now considered complete.
Deferred An approved requirement is now planned for implementation in a later release.
Deleted An implemented and approved requirement has been removed from the baseline. 
Rejected The requirement was proposed but was never approved and is not planned for implementation in any upcoming release. 
Include an explanation of why and by whom the decision was made to reject it.

REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS
• Requirements have different issues when they are in 
different status
• Resolving the issues will change the status.
• Issues (see the table)
Issue type Description
Requirement
question
Something isn’t understood or 
decided about a requirement.
Missing
requirement
Developers uncovered a missed 
requirement during design or 
implementation.
Incorrect
requirement
A requirement was wrong. It 
should be corrected or removed.
Implementati
on
Question
As developers implement 
requirements, they have 
questions about how something 
should work or about design 
alternatives.
Duplicate
Requirement
Two or more equivalent 
requirements are discovered. 
Delete all but one of them.
Unneeded
Requirement
A requirement simply isn’t needed 
anymore.

REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Requirement tracing
(see part 3)

REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Monitoring requirements effort
• Monitoring requirement efforts to adjust project plans
• Efforts of BAs are in twofold: 
Record the number of hours spent on requirements
development activities such as the following:
• Planning requirements-related activities for the 
project
• Holding workshops and interviews, analysing 
documents, and performing other elicitation 
activities
• Writing requirements specifications, creating 
analysis models, and prioritizing requirements
• Creating and evaluating prototypes intended to 
assist with requirements development
• Reviewing requirements and performing other 
validation activities
Count the effort devoted to the following activities as
requirements management effort:
• Configuring a requirements management tool for a 
project
• Submitting requirements changes and proposing 
new requirements
• Evaluating proposed changes, including performing 
impact analysis and making decisions
• Updating the requirements repository
• Communicating requirements changes to affected 
stakeholders
• Tracking and reporting requirements status
• Creating requirements trace information

PART TWO: MANAGING CHANGES (CH28)

CHANGES IN REQUIREMENT
Changes are inevitable
• The requirements for software systems typically grow between 1 percent and 3 percent per calendar 
month
• Changes need to be carefully managed because:
• Cost -- developers sometimes do not, or cannot, produce realistic estimates of the cost 
(resources and time needed) of a proposed software change.
• Back door issue -- developer may agree changes a user request to the users without having the 
changes officially approved by the right stakeholders, leading to the situation where only the 
developer and the user know the change but all others do not.
• Scope creep -- the project becomes bigger and bigger because it continuously incorporates more 
functionalities without adjusting resources, schedules, or quality goals.
• Impacts to others components -- the late changes can have a big impact on work already 
performed.

PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES
Principles
• Proposed requirements changes are thoughtfully evaluated before being committed to (cost and scope).
• Appropriate individuals make informed business decisions about requested changes (back door).
• Change activity is made visible to affected stakeholders (impact).
• Approved changes are communicated to all affected participants (back door and impact).
• The project incorporates requirements changes in a consistent and effective fashion (scope, back door).
Control policies
• All changes must follow the process.
• No design or implementation other than feasibility exploration will be performed on unapproved changes.
• The project’s change control board (CCB) will decide which changes to implement.
• The contents of the change database must be visible to all project stakeholders (or it can be a spreadsheet).
• Impact analysis must be performed for every change.
• Every change must be traceable to an approved change request.
• The rationale behind every approval or rejection of a change request must be recorded.

PROCESS AND CHANGE CONTROL BOARD (CCB)
CCB
• Responsibility – decide changes based on the proposed change or a set of changes, and the rational
• Roles – who will take part and what are the responsibilities of the participants
Role Description and responsibilities
Chair Chairperson of the change control board; generally has final
decision-making authority if the CCB does not reach agreement; identifies the Evaluator 
and the Modifier for each change request
Evaluator Person whom the CCB Chair asks to analyse the impact of a
proposed change (to cost, scope, impacts, resources)
Modifier Person who is responsible for making changes in a work product in response to an 
approved change request
Originator Person who submits a new change request (BA)
Request
Receiver
Person who initially receives newly submitted change requests (CCB secretory)
Verifier Person who determines whether the change was made correctly
CCB The group that decides to approve or reject proposed changes fora specific project

PROCESS AND CHANGE CONTROL 
BOARD (CCB)
• CCB process (rectangles represent the status of changes)
• Entry criteria -- the conditions that must be satisfied 
before the process execution can begin
• The various tasks of CCB:
• Evaluate change request: technical feasibility, 
cost, alignment with the project’s business 
requirements and resource constraints, impact 
analysis, risk and hazard analysis
• Make a decision on whether accept or reject, 
and if accept, priority, target implementation 
date, allocating the change to a specific iteration 
or release
• Implement change
• Verification – against a set of criteria


PROCESS AND CHANGE CONTROL 
BOARD (CCB)
• CCB process (continue)
• Exit criteria, the conditions that indicate when the 
process is successfully completed, such as:
• The status of the request is Rejected, Closed, or 
Cancelled.
• All modified work products are updated and 
stored in the correct locations.
• The relevant stakeholders have been notified of 
the change details and the status of the change 
request.
• Reporting --


PROCESS AND CHANGE CONTROL BOARD (CCB)
Members from
• Project or program management (scope, resources)
• Business analysis or product management (cost)
• Development (feasibility)
• Testing or quality assurance (traceability)
• Marketing, the business for which the application is being built, or customer representatives (impact)
• Technical support or help desk (impact)
Decision making
• The CCB membership
• The decision rules to be used
• Whether the CCB Chair can overrule the CCB’s collective decision
• Whether CCB Chair or management must ratify the group’s decision


CHANGE IMPACT ANALYSIS
Impact analysis involves three steps:
• Step 1: Understand the possible 
implications of making the change. A 
requirement change often produces a large 
side-effect, leading to modifications in 
other requirements, architectures, designs, 
code, and tests. Changes can lead to 
conflicts with other requirements or can 
compromise quality attributes, such as 
performance or security.
(checklist of questions to help the evaluator 
understand the implications of accepting a 
proposed change)


CHANGE IMPACT ANALYSIS
• Step 2: Identify all the requirements, files, models, and documents that might have to be modified if the 
team incorporates the requested change.
(questions to help identify all software elements and other work products that the change might affect)


CHANGE IMPACT ANALYSIS
• Step 3: Identify the tasks required to implement the change, 
and estimate the effort needed to complete those tasks.


PART THREE: TRACE CHANGES (CH29)

BENEFITS
• Requirement changes seem simple but often have far-reaching impacts 
(e.g. scope creed can be not obvious)
• Tracing changes brings the following good things:
• Finding missing requirements.
• Finding unnecessary requirements via change impact analysis by comparing before and after the 
change is introduced
• Certification and compliance -- trace information can demonstrate that all requirements were 
implemented.
• Maintenance -- Reliable trace information tells changes are correctly completed.
• Project tracking – trace information provides an accurate record of the implementation status of 
planned functionality.
• Reengineering.
• Reuse -- Trace information identifying packages of related requirements, designs, code, and tests
• Testing -- links between tests, requirements, and code can tell the likely areas to examine for 
defects.


SHOW TRACEABILITY
• Diagram shows the traceability  relationships 
between different types of requirements, and 
hence the impacts of a change in upstream to 
the components in downstream.
• For example, that a tester is confused about the 
testing results might mean some changes are 
introduced in functional requirement.
• Another example is that some changes may take 
place in functional requirement if architecture is 
no longer satisfying functional requirement. 


SHOW TRACEABILITY
• The requirements traceability matrix shows how each functional requirement is linked backward to a 
specific use case and forward to one or more design, code, and test elements, for example
User

REQUIREMENTS TRACING ACTIVITIES (GOOD PRACTICE)
• Explain the team and management about the concepts and importance of requirements tracing.
• Explain the selected link relationships from, e.g. the diagram from the previous slide.
• Explain traceability matrix, e.g. the table on the previous slide.
• Identify the parts of the software for which you want to maintain traceability information. Start with the 
critical core functions, the high-risk portions, or the portions that undergo the most maintenance and 
evolution over the product’s life.
• Identify the individuals who will supply each type of link information and the person (most likely a BA) 
who will coordinate the tracing activities and manage the data.
• Modify development procedures to remind developers to update the links after implementing a 
requirement or an approved change.
• Define the labelling conventions to give each system element a unique identifier so that they can be 
linked together.
• As development proceeds, let each participant provide the requested trace information as they 
complete small bodies of work.
