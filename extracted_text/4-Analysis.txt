REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

PART ONE: MODELLING (CH8) 

USER STORIES
User stories
• A user story is a “short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who 
desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system”
• ”Standard” format of user story is: As a <type of user>, I want <a goal> so that <some reasons>.
• This contains the following key information:
• Role of the user playing in a system <type of user> -- who
• Goals to achieve <a goal> -- what
• The reasons for achieving the goal <some reasons> -- Why 
• Process of establishing user stories (divide and conquer)
• Start from a big goal
• Split the goal into smaller


USER STORIES
• Agile software development uses user stories to represent user requirements.
• A user story will be broken down (refined) into detailed and smaller ones. Normally a user story 
should be small enough to fit in one iteration in Agile , so an acceptance test is carried out at the 
end of the iteration. 
• Some examples of user stories: 
Application Sample use case Corresponding user story
Chemical tracking 
system
Request a Chemical As a chemist, I want to request a chemical so that I can perform 
experiments.
Airport check-in kiosk Check in for a Flight As a traveler, I want to check in for a flight so that I can fly to my 
destination.
Accounting system Create an Invoice As a small business owner, I want to create an invoice so that I can bill a 
customer.
Online bookstore Update Customer Profile As a customer, I want to update my customer profile so that future 
purchases are billed to a new credit card number.

USE CASES
• Use case, represented either with a table or use case diagrams and activity diagrams, provides a 
high-level visual representation of users’ operations from which the user requirements can be 
drawn.
• Elements:
• An actor is a person (or sometimes another software system or a hardware device) that 
interacts with the system to perform a use case
• A use case might encompass a number of related activities leading to a goal. A scenario is a 
description of a single instance of the usage of the system. A use case is therefore a collection of 
related usage scenarios, and one scenario is a specific instance of a use case.
• identify actors:
• Who (or what) is notified when something occurs within the system?
• Who (or what) provides information or services to the system?
• Who (or what) triggers the system to start a task?

USE CASES
• Identifying use cases in several ways:
• Identify the actors first, then lay out the business processes being supported by the system 
secondly, and then define the use cases for activities where actors and systems interact.
• Create specific scenarios to illustrate a business process, then generalise the scenarios into use 
cases and identify the actors involved in each one.
• Using a business process description, ask, “What tasks must the system perform to complete 
this process or convert the inputs into outputs?” Those tasks might be the use cases.
• Identify the external events to which the system must respond, then relate these events to 
participating actors and specific use cases.
• Use CRUD analysis to identify data entities that require use cases to create, read, update, 
delete, or otherwise manipulate them.
• Examine the context diagram and ask, “What objectives do each of these external entities want 
to achieve with the help of the system?”

USE CASES
• Use cases can be represented in either table or activity diagram, and they must have the following 
elements: 
• A unique identifier and a succinct name that states the user goal
• A brief textual description that describes the purpose of the use case
• A trigger condition that initiates the execution of the use case
• Zero or more preconditions that must be satisfied before the use case can begin
• One or more postconditions that describe the state of the system after the use case is 
successfully completed
• Something observable to the user (the system displayed an account balance).
• Physical outcomes (the ATM has dispensed cash and printed a receipt).
• Internal system state changes (the account has been debited by the amount of a cash 
withdrawal, plus any transaction fees).
• A numbered list of steps that shows the sequence of interactions between the actor and the 
system—a dialog—that leads from the preconditions to the postconditions

USE CASES
• Table example
• (Exercise: convert the table to use 
case diagram and activity diagram 
in UML?)
Action schema:
Precondition+action+postcondition.
Precondition is sufficient for action
Postcondition is the consequence

USE CASES
• Activity diagram
• One scenario is identified as the normal flow of 
events for the use case. It’s also called the main flow, 
basic flow, normal course, primary scenario, main 
success scenario, sunny-day scenario, and happy 
path.
• Other success scenarios within the use case are 
called alternative flows or secondary scenarios. 
Alternative flows deliver the same business outcome 
(sometimes with variations) as the normal flow but 
represent less common or lower-priority variations 
in the specifics of the task or how it is 
accomplished.


USE CASES
• Example and exercise: 
System description: The system controls a recycling machine for returnable bottles, cans and 
crates. The machine can be used by several customers at the same time and each customer can 
return all three types of item on the same occasion.
The current business process:
The counter has to check, for each item, what type has been 
returned. He will register how many items each customer returns and 
when the customer asks for a receipt, the counter will print out what 
was deposited , the value of the returned items and the total return 
sum that will be paid to the customer. A manager monitors the 
counter. He asks for a printout of the total number of items that have 
been deposited at the end of each day. He has right to change the 
deposit values of the items through a console. When anything wrong 
with the process, the manager will be called by the counter by 
sending a special alarm signal. 

USE CASES
• Identify actors who are outsiders of the recycling process but interact to it
• Identify use cases that representing sequences of activities
Returning items
Changing item values
Generating daily report


USE CASES
• Activity diagram provides detailed activities 
within use cases
• focusing on return item use case
When a customer returns an item to the 
machine, the following activities should 
happen in the system: 
• Register the item
• Classify (crate | can | bottle) 
• Increment item quantity
• Increment item value.

PART TWO: BUSINESS RULES AS CONSTRAINS (CH9)

BUSINESS RULES
Definition 
• Software must follow policies, laws, and industry standard and government regulations. All of these 
are called business rules
• Definitions from the perspectives of both the business and its information systems:
• From the business perspective: “A business rule is the guidance indicating an obligation 
concerning conduct, action, practice, or procedure within a particular activity or sphere.” (There 
ought to be an explicit motivation for the rule, as well as enforcement methods and an 
understanding of what the consequences would be if the rule were broken.)
• From the information system perspective: “A business rule is a statement that defines or 
constrains some aspect of the business. It is intended to assert business structure or to control 
or influence the behaviour of the business.”
• Examples? (Agresso – expenditure refund procedure requires 
     authorisation from budget holder, line manager and finance,
     and double check by salaries.)


BUSINESS RULES
A business rules taxonomy (How business rules are classified/organised)
• Facts are simply statements that are true about the business at a specified point in time. A fact 
describes associations or relationships between important business terms. Example:
• Every order has a shipping charge. (predicate)
• Action enabler that triggers some activities if specific conditions are true. Example:
• If the customer ordered a product of certain, then offer the customer the related product 
before completing the order (we all experienced this from Amazon/Jingdong/……) (?)
• An inference creates a new fact from other facts, often in the form of “if/then”. (Difference to 
action-enabling business rules, in the way that the “then” clause of an inference simply provides a 
piece of knowledge, not an action to be taken. Example: 
• If a payment is not received within 30 calendar days after it is due, then the account is 
delinquent. (rule)
Inference in predicate logic:
Premise 1: A
Premise 2: If A then B
-----------------------------
Conclusion: B

BUSINESS RULES
• Computations transform existing data into new data by using specific mathematical formulas or 
algorithms. (actually, computation is a combination of a set of fact and a set of inferences)
• Examples
• The total price for an order is the sum of the price of the items ordered, less any volume 
discounts, plus state and county sales taxes for the location to which the order is being shipped, 
plus the shipping charge, plus an optional insurance charge.
• (Can be in other format rather than text -- The unit price is reduced by 10 percent for orders of 
6 to 10 units, by 20 percent for orders of 11 to 20 units, and by 30 percent for orders of more 
than 20 units) 
ID Number of units purchased Percent discount
DISC-1 1 through 5 0
DISC-2 6 through 10 10
DISC-3 11 through 20 20
DISC-4 More than 20 30

BUSINESS RULES
• A constraint is a statement that restricts the actions that the system or its users are allowed to 
perform. (fact?)
• Organizational policies
• A library patron may have a maximum of 10 items on hold at any time.
• Any credit card transaction does not display more than four digits of the card number. 
• Government regulations 
• All software applications must comply with government regulations for usage by visually 
impaired persons. (You see the wheelchair symbol on websites.)
• Airline pilots must receive at least 8 continuous hours of rest in every 24-hour period. 
(Flight stops in HK when flying from London to Australia.)
• Industry standards 
• Mortgage loan applicants must satisfy the Federal Housing Authority qualification 
standards. (e,g. age check.)
• Web applications may not contain any HTML tags or attributes that are deprecated 
according to the HTML 5 standard.


BUSINESS RULES
Document business rules
• Try the simple format
ID Rule definition Type of rule Static or dynamic Source
ORDER-5 If the customer ordered a book 
by an author who has written 
multiple books, then offer the 
author’s other books to the 
customer before completing the 
order.
Action enabler Static Marketing policy XX
ACCESS-8 All website images must include 
alternative text to be used by 
electronic reading devices to 
meet accessibility requirements 
for visually impaired users.
Constraint Static ADA Standards for 
Accessible Design
DISCOUNT-13 A discount is calculated based on 
the size of the current order, as 
defined in Table BR-060.
Computation Dynamic Corporate pricing 
policy XX

BUSINESS RULES
Discover business rules
• Asking questions from different perspectives 
(see the diagram)
• “Common knowledge” from individuals who 
have worked with the business for a long time
• Legacy systems 
• Business process modelling
• Existing documentation
• Compliance departments in companies as they 
ensure that a business adheres to external 
rules and internal controls
• Observation and reasoning


BUSINESS RULES
Business rules into requirements
• Consider a retail store’s policy that only supervisors and managers are allowed to issue cash refunds 
larger than £50. If you’re developing a point-of-sale application for use by store employees, this rule 
implies that each user must have a privilege level. The software must check to see if the current user 
is of sufficiently high privilege level to perform certain actions, such as opening the cash register 
drawer so a cashier can issue a refund to a customer. 
Exercise: I went to Coop supermarket yesterday 
afternoon. I picked up a French bread and a bottle of 
milk and tried to pay with a self-service pay station. I 
scanned the milk but could not scan the bread. The shop 
assistant told me that I had to place the milk to the 
packaging area and then I could scan the next item. 
What business rule is here?


PART THREE: REQUIREMENTS PRIORITISATION (CH16)

REASONS FOR PRIORITISATION
• Few software projects deliver all the capabilities on time and in budget. Every project with resource 
limitations needs to define the relative priorities of the requested product capabilities.
• Delivers the most critical or valuable functionality as early as possible (to ensure customers that 
their investment is in safe hands.)
• On every project, a project manager must balance the desired project scope against the constraints 
of schedule, budget, staff, and quality goals.
• One way to accomplish this is to drop—or to defer to a later release—low-priority requirements 
when new, more essential requirements are accepted or when other project conditions change.
• Prioritisation also helps reveal competing goals, resolve conflicts, plan for staged or incremental 
deliveries, control scope creep, in addition to make the necessary trade-off decisions.

HOW TO PRIORITISE
In or out model
• The simplest of all prioritization methods is to have a group of stakeholders work down a list of 
requirements and make a binary decision: is it-in, or is it-out, based on the project’s business 
objectives. Then, reduce the list down to the bare minimum needed for the first release. Then, when 
implementation of that release is under way, come back to the previously “out” requirements and 
go through the process again for the next release.
• Pairwise comparison and rank ordering – pairwise compare requirements using a spreadsheet.
A B C D E
A < ∧ < <
B ∧ < <
C < <
D <
E
Example: Ranking requirements A, B, C, D, E
From the first row: C is more important than A
Also from the first row: A is more important than B, D and E
From the second row: B is more important than D and E
From the fourth row: D is more important than E
C, A, B, D, E

HOW TO PRIORITISE
Three-level scale
• A common prioritisation approach groups requirements into three categories: high, medium, and 
low priority.
• One way to assess priority is to consider the two dimensions of importance and urgency
• High-priority requirements are both important (customers 
need the capability) and urgent (customers need it in the next 
release).
• Medium-priority requirements are important (customers 
need the capability) but not urgent (they can wait for a later 
release). 
• Low-priority requirements are neither important (customers 
can live without the capability if necessary) nor urgent 
(customers can wait, perhaps forever).
• Requirements in the fourth quadrant appear to be urgent, 
perhaps for political reasons, but not important in terms of 
the system’s functionality. So no need waste your time 
working on these.


HOW TO PRIORITISE
• Then, Repeat the process in the following way:


HOW TO PRIORITISE
MSCW model
• The four capitalized letters in the MSCW prioritisation scheme stand for four possible priority 
classifications for the requirements in a set:
• Must: The requirement must be satisfied for the solution to be considered a success.
• Should: The requirement is important and should be included in the solution if possible, but it’s 
not mandatory to success.
• Could: It’s a desirable capability, but one that could be deferred or eliminated. Implement it 
only if time and resources permit.
• Won’t: This indicates a requirement that will not be implemented at this time but could be 
included in a future release.
• The MSCW scheme changes the three-level scale of high, medium, and low into a four-level scale. It 
doesn’t offer any rationale for making the decision about how to rate the priority of a given 
requirement compared to others.

HOW TO PRIORITISE
Value, cost, and risk model
• Value = benefit*weight + penalty*weight
• Cost = ∑cost(i)*weight(i)
• Risk = ∑risk(i)*weight(i)
• Priority = value/(cost + risk)
Prioritisation is an optimisation process. Any optimalisation process must have an objective. In mathematics and 
AI, the objective is described using the so-called objective function which has the objective as the dependent 
variable, something that can be manipulated to change the value of the objective as the decision variables, as 
well as something that cannot be changed as parameters. Standard optimisation process has the formular of 
minimising the objective described with the objective function under a set of constraints. 
In the above, 
Objective function -- Priority = (benefit*weight_b + penalty*weight_p) / (∑cost(i)*weight(i) + ∑risk(i)*weight(i))
Decision variables – benefit, penalty, cost(i), risk(i)
Parameters – all the weights
Constraints – cost < A and risk < B

PART FOUR: A TRUE STORY

1. USER FIRST 
Karen is a business analyst on a project to implement a new online catalogue for the company’s customer 
service representatives (CSRs). The draft SRS is going through review when the marketing manager says 
he wants to add a “Like this product” feature. Karen’s first instinct is to push back, there is already 
concern about meeting schedules with the current requirements set. But then she realised that may be 
that is a smart feature to add, because CSRs can promote the most-liked products with other customers. 
Before she elicits and documents the functional requirements for this feature, she needs an objective 
analysis about whether this feature should be added to the scope or not. 
When she explained to the marketing manager the need to analyse this request feature, he responds, 
“well, soon the developers are going to be in there changing code anyway. How hard is it to add just a tiny 
feature?” Karen’s analysis determines that the proposed feature lies outside the project’s scope: It would 
not contribute the business objectives to reduce CSRs’ average call time and it won’t simple to 
implement. Karen needs to be able to clearly articulate why the feature is not in scope to the marketing 
manager, who doesn’t have the business objectives readily in mind. 
Qs: Who is the user? What is the business objective?  

2. LUTON DSC
Disable Services Centre (DSC) provides its customers with services such as hiring and purchasing 
assistance equipment and rehabilitation equipment. DPS has a number of departments and branches 
in Luton and in other small towns near Luton.
Business objective: DSC wanted to replace its CRM system as the legacy system was not supported by 
the developer any more. DSC has to have a new one to manage the services provided to its customers.
User requirements elicitation: The heads of all departments and branches gathered together and 
described how business is running in their department/branches. 
Diagrams on the next slide show how its Equipment Department operates. 
Diagrams on Slides 44 to 45 show how we documented the requirements.

2. LUTON DSC
Interruption: DSC manager stepped in to override the user requirements collected from the 
meetings, leading to internal disagreements withing the company, and added in more and more 
requirements which is beyond the scope of that project
Disaster: DSC do not have personnel who is able to transfer data from the old system to the new 
one and the software company that developed the old system refused to help.
