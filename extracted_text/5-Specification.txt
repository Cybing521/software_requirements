REQUIREMENT 
SPECIFICATION

PART ONE: SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS 
(SRS) (CHs 10 AND 11)

SRS AS REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT
• SRS describes the expected outcomes from analysis stage
• Functions – what the software can deliver given inputs (?)
• Capabilities – what the software can do and cannot do
• Features – what the software looks different from others 
(Distinctive behaviours? What about other behaviours?)
• Constraints – what rules/regulations the software must follow 
(business rules and IT industry standards)
• System behaviours under various conditions (behaviours other 
than features)
• Qualities – containing internal and external qualities
• SRS itself is also the output of specification stage.
• It is the basis for subsequential project planning, design, and coding, 
as well as the foundation for system testing and user documentation
• Creating SRS is a process of specifying requirements.
This image shows the capability 
of problem-solving which is 
supported by four functionalities 
– questioning, searching, 
creating and implementing. 

SRS AUDIENCES 
• Customers (users) – they need to know what product they can expect to be delivered from SRS
• Project managers – they plan/monitor/amend timeline, effort, and resources based on 
requirements given in SRS
• Software development teams – they need to know what to build as specified in SRS.
• Testers – they use SRS to develop requirements-based tests, test plans, and test procedures.
• Maintenance and support staff – they use SRS to understand what each part of the product is 
supposed to do and in relation to other parts/systems.
• Documentation writers – they develop user manuals and help screens as stated in the SRS, in 
particular, the features given by user interface.
• Training personnel – they use the SRS and user documentation to develop training tutorials.
• Legal staff – they need to ensure that the requirements comply with applicable laws and regulations.
• Subcontractors – they are contracted based on the specified requirements

SRS STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS
1. Introduction section 
An overview to help the reader understand how the SRS is organized 
and how to use it.
• Purpose
• the purpose of the project, i.e. product or application to be 
developed in the project to which the requirements are 
associated (“to develop the product of ….”)
• the targeted audiences of the document (specify as mentioned 
in the previous slide)
• Document conventions – standards/conventions in terms of format 
used in the document (e.g. IOS/IEC/IEEE)
• Scope – what the project will achieve and what are not its concerns 
• References – resources the document refers to 


SRS STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS
2. Overall description section
A high-level overview (general, no details is needed) of the product and the environment in which the 
product will be used, the anticipated users, and known constraints, assumptions, and dependencies
• Product perspective -- the product’s context and origin (why it is needed)
• User classes and characteristics – the targeted users and their characteristics (who are going to 
use it and in which ways they are going to use)
• Operating environment -- including the hardware platform; operating systems and versions; 
geographical locations of users, servers, and databases; and organisations that host the related 
databases, servers, and websites (hardly to have a stand-alone system now)
• Design and implementation constraints -- any factors that will restrict the options available to 
the developers and the rationale for each constraint, such as the limitations of programming 
language and library to be used, etc. (technical constraints rather than business rules)
• Assumptions – functionalities related (e.g. all mobile phones have touch-screen)
• dependencies – external factors that are not controllable, e.g. a certain version of .NET

SRS STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS
3. System features section 
Set up sub-headings for each features (required by customers) and describe the features one after 
another in the corresponding sub-headings
• 3.x System feature x (sub-heading)
3.x.1. Description 
• What feature x is
• The priority level in terms of development of feature x
3.x.2. Functional requirements (raised by customers)
• Itemised functional requirements associated with feature x, i.e. what functions and capabilities 
the software should have to realise this feature 
(The above should be repeatedly used for all features.)
Note, we are talking about requirements here but not system specifications! Therefore, the features 
and functions are those that customers required. 

SRS STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS
Exercise 1: Shopping Cart? 
What are the features of a Shopping Cart? 
What are functions that support the features?
Exercise 2: Smart Shopping with smart scanner
Imagine and name two features?  
Imagine and name functions that support the features?


SRS STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS
4. Data requirements section (more details in Part Two)
Defining the types of data the software will be used as inputs, as intermedium variables and as the 
outputs
• Logical data model such as entity-relationship diagrams (types of data for each column) and UML 
class diagrams (date types)
• Data dictionary – defines the composition of data structures and the meaning, data type, length, 
format, and allowed values for the data elements
• Reports – management reports generated from IT systems, their format, size, language, tables, 
diagrams, etc
• Data acquisition (all about data protection), including consents (purpose, life-cycle, who to use), 
integrity (keep quality when transferred), retention (keep in a safe place), and disposal processes 
(destroy)

SRS STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS
5. External interface requirements section
Specifying how the system communicate the user as well as external software and hardware
6. Non-functional requirements section (more in Part Three)
• Performance – such as speed of response, throughput, execution time and storage capacity
• Security – information security is a big issue now
• Accessibility – for people who have disabilities 
7. Internationalisation and localisation section
Internationalisation and localisation requirements ensure that the product will be suitable for use in 
nations, cultures, and geographic locations other than those in which it was created. (Imagine if JD has 
had Chinese-language version only, it would not be internationalised.)
8. Other requirements section
• Legal, regulatory, or financial compliance and standards requirements
• Product installation, configuration, start-up, and shutdown; and logging, monitoring, and audit 
trail requirements.

SRS VALIDATING
The collected individual requirements need to be validated according to the following criteria:   
• Complete – Containing all detailed information (e.g. fond – style, size, colour, effects)
• Correct – not saying the wrong things
• Feasible – achievable given capabilities and limitations of the system and its operating environment, 
as well as time, budget, human resources, etc. 
• Necessary – leading to the anticipated business value, differentiating to the product in the 
marketplace, or being required for conformance to an external standard, policy, or regulation.
• Prioritised – ranking business requirements according to which are most important to achieving the 
desired value. 
• Unambiguous – not misleading or causing misunderstanding (“He is cooking apple”)
• Verifiable – one can check whether the requirement is achieved at the end

PART TWO: DATA (CH13)

DATA MODELLING
Data specifications are about what data will be manipulated in a software system. It is important as 
software functionality is all about data – create, read, update and delete data
ER model
• An analysis process aiming to specify data entities themselves and the relationships among them
• Entity relationship diagram as a 
common data model (ER model)
• Entities (data items) – data 
aggregations or physical items –
attributes – features of data items
• Relationships/associations – logical 
linkage between data item pair
• Multiplicity – the number of entity type 
instances that can be at one end of an 
association

DATA DICTIONARY
• Date dictionary is a metadata repository – information about data such as meaning, relationships to 
other data, origin, usage, and format, or collection of tables about metadata.
• Example:


CRUD MATRIX
• CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and 
Delete.
• A CRUD matrix correlates system actions with 
data entities to show where and how each 
significant data entity is created, read, updated, 
and deleted.
• Types of correlations, including the following:
• Data entities and system events
• Data entities and user tasks or use cases
• Object classes and use cases
• CRUD has a lot of more than just the matrix but 
for requirement specification, the matrix is the 
focus.
• Example (Data entities and user tasks):


DATA SPECIFICATION
Case study –Chemical tracking system
• “ER” model
• CRUD matrix, e.g. The first row means: Place order use 
case: an order is C’ed, data about chemical, requester 
and supplier’s catalogue are R’ed
• CRUD also tells the methods each use case should 
have, e.g. The third row means: Chemical inventory has 
methods of C’s, U’s and D’s chemical data in the DB. If 
data is not manual manipulated, a class of Inventory 
can be defined.


REPORT
IT systems generate reports
• What are the sources of the data and the selection criteria for pulling data from the repository?
• What parameters are selectable by the user?
• What calculations or other data transformations are required?
• What are the criteria for sorting, page breaks, and totals?
• How should the system respond if no data is returned in response to a query when attempting to 
generate this report?
• Should the underlying data of the report be made available to the user for ad hoc reporting?
• Can this report be used as a template for a set of similar reports?

PART THREE: QUALITY (CH14)

QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Reasons to discuss non-functional requirements
• In addition to functionalities, users also have 
expectations, often unstated, about how well 
the product will work
• Excellent products reflect an optimal balance of 
competing quality characteristics – so there is a 
need to identify and prioritise quality attributes. 
(Think about .NET IDE. It is so convenient for us 
to develop a GUI, but the IDE has gone to too 
complex. Whilst Java allow you to program on 
any text editor, but it is not easy to implement a 
GUI compared with .NET – my experience 10 
yeas ago.)
Classification
• External quality factors are what the user can see 
and hence are primarily important to users,
• Internal qualities factors refer to what developer 
can see, therefore are more significant to 
development and maintenance staff.
• (More on the next slide)

QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Two classes: 
• User 
interests
• Developer 
interests 
External quality Brief description
Availability
Installability
Integrity
Interoperability
Performance
Reliability
Robustness
Safety
Security
Usability
The extent to which the system’s services are available when and where they are needed
How easy it is to correctly install, uninstall, and reinstall the application
The extent to which the system protects against data inaccuracy and loss
How easily the system can interconnect and exchange data with other systems or 
components
How quickly and predictably the system responds to user inputs or other events
How long the system runs before experiencing a failure
How well the system responds to unexpected operating conditions
How well the system protects against injury or damage
How well the system protects against unauthorized access to the application and its data
How easy it is for people to learn, remember, and use the system
Internal quality Brief description
Efficiency
Modifiability
Portability
Reusability
Scalability
Verifiability
How efficiently the system uses computer resources
How easy it is to maintain, change, enhance, and restructure the system
How easily the system can be made to work in other operating environments
To what extent components can be used in other systems
How easily the system can grow to handle more users, transactions, servers, etc.
How readily developers and testers can confirm that the software was implemented
correctly

EXTERNAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Availability = MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR) where MTBF is the mean time between failures and MTTR is the 
mean time in repairing. Availability is closely related to reliability and is strongly affected by the 
maintainability subcategory of modifiability. Availability can be:
• System up time between XX to YY , down time from AA to BB
• Warmings or alerts before maintenance
Increasing a system’s Installability reduces the time, cost, user disruption, error frequency, and skill 
level needed for an installation operation. A measure of a system’s installability is the mean time to 
install the system. Examples are:
• An untrained user shall be able to successfully perform an initial installation of the application in an 
average of 10 minutes.
• When installing an upgraded version of the application, all customizations in the user’s profile shall 
be retained and converted to the new version’s data format if needed.
• The installation program shall verify the correctness of the download before beginning the 
installation process.
• Installing this software on a server requires administrator privileges.
• Following successful installation, the installation program shall delete all temporary, backup, 
obsolete, and unneeded files associated with the application.

EXTERNAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Data Integrity also addresses the accuracy, completeness and proper formatting of the data.
• Example of requirements:
• After performing a file backup, the system shall verify the backup copy against the original and 
report any discrepancies.
• The system shall protect against the unauthorised addition, deletion, or modification of data.
• The Chemical Tracking System shall confirm that an encoded chemical structure imported for 
third-party structure-drawing tools represents a valid chemical structure.
• The system shall confirm daily that the application executables have not been modified by the 
addition of unauthorized code.
Interoperability indicates how readily the system works with others, e.g. exchanging data and services 
with other software systems and being integrated with external hardware devices. 
• Example:
• A web-based health care information system should be able to Import sensing data from IoT, to 
search information from the Internet and to use predictive models from cloud. 

EXTERNAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Performance 
Performance dimension Example
Response time Number of seconds to display a webpage
Throughput Credit card transactions processed per second
Data capacity Maximum number of (records stored in a database -- really? Do
we see any user ask the size of a DB?) info can be saved 9 gb.
(Google mail says you can save infinity number of emails)
Dynamic capacity Maximum number of concurrent users of a social media website
Predictability in real-time systems Foresee road condition of auto car
Latency (I think this is a fabrication.
Latency is related to networking.
User only sees response time)
Time delays in music recording and production software
Behaviour in degraded modes or
overloaded conditions
A natural disaster leads to a massive number of emergency
telephone system calls (My MacBook pro cannot cope with MS 
Teams meeting when I switched on recording.)

EXTERNAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Ways to specify and measure software Reliability include the percentage of operations that are 
completed correctly, the average length of time the system runs before failing (MTBF), and the 
maximum acceptable probability of a failure during a given time period. Examples:
• One failure in 1000 runs
• MTBF of the card reader component shall be at least 90 days (how many hours does Karl use the 
card reader in 90 days?)
• Fault rate is 3 in 1000 hours
Robustness is the degree to which a system continues to function properly when confronted with 
invalid inputs, defects in connected software or hardware components, external attack, or unexpected 
operating conditions. Good example is the text editor, such as
• If the text editor fails before the user saves the file, it shall recover the contents of the file being 
edited as of, at most, one minute prior to the failure the next time the same user launches the 
application. (MS office)
Safety – If a software system is to control a hardware, injuries and damages are possible.

EXTERNAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Security is a major issue with Internet software and cloud computing
Some considerations to examine when eliciting security requirements
• User authorisation or privilege levels (ordinary user, guest user, administrator) and user access 
controls (the roles and permissions matrix can be a useful tool)
• User identification and authentication (password construction rules, password change 
frequency, security questions, forgotten logon name or password procedures, biometric 
identification, account locking after unsuccessful access attempts, unrecognized computer)
• Data privacy (who can create, see, change, copy, print, and delete what information)
• Deliberate (consider) data destruction, corruption, or theft
• Protection against viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, rootkits, and other malware
• Firewall and other network security issues
• Encryption of secure data
• Building audit trails of operations performed and access attempts

EXTERNAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Possible ways to improve Usability (user-friendliness, ease of use, and human engineering)
Ease of learning Ease of use
Verbose prompts Keyboard shortcuts
Wizards Rich, customisable menus and toolbars
Visible menu options Multiple ways to access the same function
Meaningful, plain-language 
messages
Autocompletion of entries
Help screens and tooltips Autocorrection of errors
Similarity to other familiar systems Macro recording and scripting capabilities
Limited number of options and 
widgets displayed 
Ability to carry over information from a 
previous transaction
Automatically fill in form fields
Command-line interface
Does the image below 
ring the bell for you? 
People joked about 
MS windows about 
how to start the 
system years ago. 
Now, even electric cars 
adopt the same 
symbol. 

INTERNAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES (???)
Efficiency is closely related to the external quality attribute of performance. Efficiency is a measure of 
how well the system utilizes processor capacity, disk space, memory, or communication bandwidth. 
Efficiency - and hence performance - is a driving factor in systems architecture, influencing how a 
designer elects to distribute computations and functions across system components. 
• Examples:
• At least 30 percent of the processor capacity and memory available to the application shall be 
unused at the planned peak load conditions.
• The system shall provide the operator with a warning message when the usage load exceeds 80 
percent of the maximum planned capacity.
Ways to measure Modifiability include the average time required to add a capability or fix a problem, 
and the percentage of fixes that are made correctly. It is closely related to maintenance.
• Examples:
• A certified repair technician shall be able to replace the scanner module in 10 minutes.
• The printer shall display an error message if replacement ink cartridges were not inserted in the 
proper slots.

INTERNAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES
Portability has become increasingly important as applications must run in multiple environments, such 
as Windows, Mac, and Linux; iOS and Android; and PCs, tablets, and phones. Some practitioners 
include the ability to internationalize and localize a product under the heading of portability. 
• Examples:
• Modifying the iOS version of the application to run on Android devices shall require changing no 
more than 10 percent of the source code.
• The user shall be able to port browser bookmarks to and from Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, 
Chrome, and Safari.
Reusable software must be modular, well documented, independent of a specific application and 
operating environment, and somewhat generic in capability.
Scalability address the ability of the application to grow to accommodate more users, data, servers, 
geographic locations, transactions, network traffic, searches, and other services without compromising 
performance or correctness. Scalability has both hardware and software implications.
Designing software for Verifiability means making it easy to place the software into the desired pre-
test state, to provide the necessary test data, and to observe the result of the test.

IDENTIFICATION AND RANKING
The need for ranking
• Not all software system need to address all the internal and external quality attributes.
• Think about internal alone. It is a 6-d space. Some dimensions can be competing. It is hard to 
balance.
• Examples about ranking:
• Embedded systems: performance, efficiency, reliability, robustness, safety, security, usability,
• Internet and corporate applications: availability, integrity, interoperability, performance, 
scalability, security, usability
• Desktop and mobile systems: performance, security, usability

IDENTIFICATION AND RANKING
Process
• Step 1: Start with a broad taxonomy -- Begin with a rich set of quality attributes to consider, to 
reduce the likelihood of overlooking an important quality dimension.
• Step 2: Reduce the list -- Engage a cross-section of stakeholders to set up quality goals by assessing 
which of the attributes are likely to be important to the project.
• Step 3: Prioritise the attributes -- Prioritising the pertinent attributes and setitng up the focus for 
future elicitation discussions
In, Pe, Re, Se, Us, Av. Ro, Ve
Se, In, Pe, Re, Us, Av, Ro, Ve
Se, In, Pe, Us, Re, Av, Ro, Ve
……..

IDENTIFICATION AND RANKING
• Step 4: Elicit specific expectations (assigning attribute with a value) – Questions to ask are:
• What would be a reasonable or acceptable response time for retrieval of a typical patent 
application in response to a query?
• What would users consider an unacceptable response time for a typical query?
• How many simultaneous users do you expect on average?
• What’s the maximum number of simultaneous users that you would anticipate?
• What times of the day, week, month, or year have much heavier usage than usual?
• Step 5: Specify well-structured quality requirements -- using smart (Specific, Measurable, 
Achievable, Relevant, and Time-sensitive.)

QUALITY ATTRIBUTE TRADE-OFFS
This is to balance quality attributes 
requirements
• Example:
• + means indicates that increasing the 
attribute in the corresponding row 
usually has a positive effect on the 
attribute in the column.
• - means that increasing the attribute in 
that row generally adversely affects the 
attribute in the column.


PART FOUR: RISK MIGRATION (CH15)

RISKS AND PROTOTYPING
Risk, what risk?
• Requirements can be unclear because of uncertainties caused by
• vagueness
• ambiguity
• incompleteness
• inaccuracy
• changes
• These uncertainty can risk intended software leading to a system that does not 
satisfy users true requirements
• There are a lots more than user requirements, such as GDPR, IP , ethics issues such 
as the consequences of a “malfunctional” software, etc. 
• Prototypes can realise and then reduce risks. They show how intended software 
would work and the parts that do not work as well as the consequences.


RISKS AND PROTOTYPING
Types or purposes of prototypes
• From scope: mock-up (for users) and proof-of-concept (for developers)
• Frome whether you will use it in future: throwaway and evolutionary
• From form: paper-based and electronic
Mock-up: focuses on a portion of the interface.
• For the purpose of exploring some specific behaviours of the intended system, with the goal of 
refining the requirements. The mock-up helps users to judge whether a system based on the 
prototype will let them do their job in a reasonable way.
• Mock-ups can demonstrate the available functional options the user will have, the look and feel of 
the user interface (colours, layout, graphics, controls), and the navigation structure.
• Mock-up doesn’t perform any useful work, although it looks as if it should, in the sense of 
“interface”, i.e. it only show appearance but not interactions. 

RISKS AND PROTOTYPING
A proof of concept implements a slice of application functionality from the user interface through all 
the technical services layers.
• A proof-of-concept prototype works like the real system
• Develop a proof-of-concept when you’re uncertain whether a proposed architectural approach is 
feasible and sound, or when you want to optimize algorithms, evaluate a proposed database 
schema, confirm the soundness of a cloud solution, or test critical timing
Throwaway prototype is exploratory only
• For the purpose of answering questions, resolve uncertainties, and improve requirements quality
• Because it will be discarded, system quality (internal and external) are ignored. So, make sure you 
must not allow low-quality code from a throwaway prototype to migrate into a production system
Evolutionary prototype provides a solid architectural foundation for building the product incrementally 
as the requirements become clear over time. It is of high-quality in terms of software system quality.

RISKS AND PROTOTYPING
Throwaway Evolutionary
Mock-up Clarify and refine user and 
functional requirements.
Identify missing functionality.
Explore user interface approaches.
Implement core user requirements.

business needs.
Proof of
concept
Demonstrate technical
feasibility.
