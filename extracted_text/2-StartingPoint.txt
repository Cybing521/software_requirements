WHERE TO START

PART ONE: START WITH BUSINESS (CH5)

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Definition of business requirements: 
• Description of a need that leads to one or more projects to deliver a solution and the desired 
ultimate business outcomes. 
• Contents including business objectives, business opportunities, success metrics, and a vision 
statement.
• business objectives – what to achieve
• business opportunities – justification on objectives
• success metrics – objectives must be measurable 
• a vision statement – a written document to formally record the commitment
Steps:
• Identifying desired business benefits
• Product vision and project scope
• Vision -- ultimate product that will achieve the business objectives
• Scope -- portion of the ultimate product which the current project or development 
iteration will address

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Dealing with conflicting business requirements
• Principles: delivering the maximum business 
value to the primary stakeholders
• Example: Business requirements on a Kiosk 
system. The retailer, the customer and the 
developer all hope the system will provide 
them with an advantage over their current 
way of doing business.
• Customer may want a simple and 
therefore quick way of shopping
• Retailer may want customers to hang on 
in shops for longer time and buy more
• Developer may care security more so 
more time to spend on security check
• Who is the primary stakeholder?


BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Vison and scope document collects business requirements in a 
single deliverable.
• The owners who take the responsibility of the document
• Project exclusive sponsors
• Funding authorities
• BA develops the document  
• Template
• Contents of the document
• Way to produce
• Populate sections when the corresponding 
information becomes available
• But not write one after another from the top to the 
bottom


BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 1 – business requirement
• 1.1. Background: Rationale and 
context for the new product or for 
changes to be made to an existing 
one
• History or situation that led to 
the decision to build this 
product
• Gaps between the current 
products and the market 
trends, technological evolution, 
etc. 
• 1.2. Business opportunity
• Profits/benefits the new 
products could bring in a 
qualitative way
• Leading or catching the gaps
• Feasibility 
• 1.3. Business objectives
• Profits/benefits the new 
products could bring in a 
quantitative way
Financial Nonfinancial

within Y months.
• Increase market share in country 
W from X% to Y% within Z 
months.
• Reach a sales volume of X units or 
revenue of £Y within Z months.
• Achieve X% return on investment 
within Y months.
• Achieve positive cash flow on this 
product within Y months.

productivity by X% and reduce data error 
rate to no more than Y%.
• Develop an extensible platform for a family 
of related products.
• Develop specific core technology 
competencies.

unit and Y warranty calls per unit within Z 
months after shipping.
• Reduce turnaround time to X hours on Y% 
of support calls.

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 1 – business requirement (continue)
• 1.4. Success metrics
• Indication of whether a project is on 
track to meet its business objectives. 
• The metrics can be tracked during 
testing or shortly after product release
• It is important to evaluate the success 
of an individual project even Business 
objectives cannot normally be 
measured well after a project is 
complete. 
Example: Chemical Tracking System 
which contains 3 individual projects

CW TASK 5
• Task 5 is about success metrics:
• Success metrics, you may have to refine the requirements you have considered to make 
them more specific and measurable
• (Note, this part of CW is tricky because you should have business requirements identified 
first.)

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 1 – business requirement (continue)
• 1.5. Vision document
• Long-term purpose and intent (intention) of the product. 
• Elements
• For [target customers]
• Who [further specifying the needs that the target customers request] – customer and needs
• The [product name] is [specifying the product to develop, such as capabilities, key benefit, 
compelling reason to buy or use] – product (why)
• Unlike [existing products], our product [specifying the advantages over the existing ones to 
justify the need for the new product] – product (features)
Example: For scientists who need to request containers of chemicals, the Chemical Tracking Systemis an 
information system that will provide a single point of access to the chemical stockroom and to vendors. The system 
will store the location of every chemical container within the company, the quantity of material remaining in it, and 
the complete history of each container’s locations and usage. This system will save the company 25 percent on 
chemical costs in the first year of use by allowing the company to fully exploit chemicals that are already available 
within the company, dispose of fewer partially used or expired containers, and use a standard chemical purchasing 
process. Unlike the current manual ordering processes, our product will generate all reports required to comply 
with federal and state government regulations that require the reporting of chemical usage, storage, and disposal.

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 1 – business requirement (continue)
• 1.6 Business risks (and mitigation)
• Risks are related to key technical break throughs. If they cannot be achieved or satisfied, 
then the product cannot be delivered. 
• A contingent plan (Plan B) that explains how the risks will be handled need to be developed 
before any project starts but may not at requirement stage. 
• 1.7 Business assumptions and dependencies
• Conditions and resources that are related to the viability of the project. 
• Finance – does customer have enough money to support digitalised system?
• Environment – can the system survive in the current working environment?
• Society – what neighbours would think/accept?
• Ethics – would users trust the system?
• Regulations – would law or government agency allow the system?


BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 2 – Scope and limitation
• 2.1 Major features of the software to develop
• Feature tree
• 2.2 It is important to define project scope/boundary at the very beginning
• Scope presentations
• Context diagram
• Ecosystem map
• Event list
• Scope creed – functionalities expansion leads to complicity and unmanageable situations
• Timeline of implementation of the features (releases) 


BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 2 – Scope and limitation (continue) 
• Feature tree
• A feature tree is a visual depiction of the 
product’s features organized in logical 
groups, hierarchically subdividing each 
feature into further levels of detail. 
• The feature tree provides a concise view 
of all of the features planned for a 
project, making it an ideal model to show 
to executives who want a quick glance at 
the project scope. 
• A feature tree can show up to three levels 
of features, commonly called level 1 (L1), 
level 2 (L2), and level 3 (L3). L2 features 
are sub-features of L1 features, and L3 
features are sub-features of L2 features.
• Example 


• Example and exercise
• CRM system to develop for Luton DSC
• Build up a feature tree from any 
     previous or current project you 
     participated in
BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS


BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 2 – Scope and limitation (continue) 
• Context diagram
• The scope description establishes the boundary 
and connections between the system you’re 
developing and everything else in the universe. 
The context diagram visually illustrates this 
boundary.
• It identifies external entities (also 
called terminators) outside the system that 
interface to it in some way, as well as data, 
control, and material flows between the 
terminators and the system. 
• The context diagram is the top level in a data 
flow diagram developed according to the 
principles of structured analysis, but it’s a useful 
model for all projects.
• Example 


CW TASK 6
• Task 6 is about scope and limitations
• Tasks in this part:
• Develop context diagram for your group project. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 2 – Scope and limitation 
(continue) 
• Ecosystem map
• An ecosystem map shows all of the 
systems related to the system of 
interest that interact with one 
another and the nature of those 
interactions.
• Ecosystem maps differ from 
context diagrams in that they show 
other systems that have a 
relationship with the system you’re 
working on, including those 
without direct interfaces.
• Example


BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 2 – Scope and limitation (continue) 
• Event list
• An event list identifies external 
events that could trigger certain 
behaviour in the system. The event 
list depicts the scope boundary for 
the system by naming possible 
business events triggered by users, 
time-triggered (temporal) events, or 
signal events received from external 
components, such as hardware 
devices. The event list only names 
the events; the functional 
requirements that describe how the 
system responds to the events would 
be detailed in the SRS by using event-
response tables.
• Example
Exercise: Each group to compare these four “diagrams” 
with UML. What information in the four diagrams can be 
represented by which part of use case diagram or other 
UML diagrams?

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 3 – Business context
• 3.1 Stakeholders’ profiles
• Benefits they could have from project such as productivity, waste, cost, automation, ability, 
useability, business process, etc.
• Attitudes toward project (participate, contribute, positive, negative, opposite, etc.)
• Interests, characteristics
• Constrains such as business rules, regulations, resources, finance, etc.
• 3.2 Project priorities decided by taking into account of (the balance of) functionalities, quality, 
schedule, cost and human resources
• 3.3 Development considerations: the information and activities that are needed to ensure an 
effective deployment of the solution into its operating environment e.g. 
• The availability and the commitment of stakeholders
• Relationship between customers and development team
• Facilities 
• ……
Prioritisation is an optimisation process:
Min: an objective function
Subject to: conditions on variables that can 
be manipulated

PART TWO: USER, USER, USER (CH6)

REMEMBER USERS (CH6)
User classes
• What? – Users can be classified into different categories according to 
• Their access privilege or security levels (such 
as ordinary user, guest user, administrator)
• The tasks they perform during their business 
operations
• The features they use (relating to feature tree)
• The frequency with which they use the 
product
• Their application domain experience and 
computer systems expertise
• The platforms they will be using (desktop PCs, 
laptop PCs, tablets, smartphones, specialised 
devices)
• Their native language
• Whether they will interact with the system 
directly or indirectly
Then, identify the 
following four user classes:

REMEMBER USERS
Identify user classes
• Why user class? – Elicit requirements from important user classes for your project
• How? -- Collaboration pattern (brainstorming involving as many user classes as possible and then 
merge those who have the similar needs or access business process in the similar ways)
• Principle: expand then contract (see the diagram)
• Implementation -- Study the organization chart (on the next slide) to look for:
1. Departments that participate in the business 
process.
2. Departments that are affected by the business 
process.
3. Departments or role names in which either direct 
or indirect users might be found.
4. User classes that span multiple departments.
5. Departments that might have an interface to 
external stakeholders outside the company.


REMEMBER USERS
• Organisation chart (example of pharmaceutical company that develop and manufacturing drugs). 
If the software project is about tracking chemicals, then the focus should be on Drug discovery 
Department.
• Organization chart analysis reduces the likelihood that you will overlook an important class of 
users within that organisation.


REMEMBER USERS
Example
Chemical Tracking System 
Name Number Description
Chemists 
(favoured)
Approximately 
1,000 located in 6 
buildings
Chemists will request chemicals from vendors and from the chemical stockroom. Each chemist 
will use the system several times per day, mainly for requesting chemicals and tracking chemical 
containers into and out of the laboratory. The chemists need to search vendor catalogs for 
specific chemical structures imported from the tools they use for drawing structures.
Buyers 5 Buyers in the purchasing department process chemical requests. They place and track orders 
with external vendors. They know little about chemistry and need simple query facilities to 
search vendor catalogues. Buyers will not use the system’s container-tracking features. Each 
buyer will use the system an average of 25 times per day.
Chemical 
stockroom staff
6 technicians, 1 
supervisor
The chemical stockroom staff manages an inventory of more than 500,000 chemical containers. 
They will supply containers from three stockrooms, request new chemicals from vendors, and 
track the movement of all containers into and out of the stockrooms. They are the only users of 
the inventory-reporting feature. Because of their high transaction volume, features that are used 
only by the chemical stockroom staff must be automated and efficient.
Health and Safety 
Department staff 
(favoured)
1 manager The Health and Safety Department staff will use the system only to generate predefined quarterly 
reports that comply with federal and state chemical usage and disposal reporting regulations. The 
Health and Safety Department manager will request changes in the reports periodically as 
government regulations change. These report changes are of the highest priority, and 
implementation will be time critical.

REMEMBER USERS
User persona 
• A description of a hypothetical, generic and virtual person who serves as a stand-in for a group of 
users who have similar characteristics and needs
• help to understand the requirements and to design the user experience to best meet the needs 
of specific user communities
• Here’s an example of a persona for the user class “Chemists” of the Chemical Tracking System:
Fred, 41, has been a chemist at Contoso Pharmaceuticals since he received his PhD 14 years 
ago. He doesn’t have much patience with computers. Fred usually works on two projects at a 
time in related chemical areas. His lab contains approximately 300 bottles of chemicals and gas 
cylinders. On an average day, he’ll need four new chemicals from the stockroom. Two of these 
will be commercial chemicals in stock, one will need to be ordered, and one will come from the 
supply of proprietary Contoso chemical samples. On occasion, Fred will need a hazardous 
chemical that requires special training for safe handling. When he buys a chemical for the first 
time, Fred wants the material safety data sheet emailed to him automatically. Each year, Fred 
will synthesize about 20 new proprietary chemicals to go into the stockroom. Fred wants a 
report of his chemical usage for the previous month to be generated automatically and sent to 
him by email so that he can monitor his chemical exposure.

REMEMBER USERS
Connect to user representatives
• Some typical communication pathways that connect the voice of the user to the ear of the 
developer


REMEMBER USERS
Product champion (or user representative?)
• Who? 
• They are a few key members of our user community to provide the requirements. 
• Each product champion serves as the primary interface between members of a single user 
class and the project’s business analyst.
• Why?  
• What to do – the next slide.

REMEMBER USERS

enhancement requests.
• Dynamically adjust the scope of future releases or 
iterations.
• Evaluate the impact of proposed changes on users 
and business processes.
• Participate in making change decisions. 

REMEMBER USERS
• BA’s advice to product champion -- traps to avoid
• Managers override the decisions that a qualified and duly authorized product champion 
makes. Perhaps a manager has a new idea at the last minute, or thinks he knows what the 
users need. This behaviour often results in dissatisfied users and frustrated product 
champions who feel that management doesn’t trust them.
• A product champion who forgets that he is representing other customers and presents only 
his own requirements won’t do a good job. He might be happy with the outcome, but others 
likely won’t be.
• A product champion who lacks a clear vision of the new system might defer decisions to the 
BA. If all of the BA’s ideas are fine with the champion, the champion isn’t providing much 
help.
• A senior user might nominate a less experienced user as champion because she doesn’t have 
time to do the job herself. This can lead to backseat driving from the senior user who still 
wishes to strongly influence the project’s direction. 

PART THREE: CASE STUDY

CASE STUDY: THE VOICE OF THE USER 
Jeremy walked into the office of Ruth, the Director of the Drug Discovery Division at Contoso Pharmaceuticals. Ruth had 
asked the information technology team that supported Contoso’s research department to build a new application to help 
the research chemists accelerate their exploration for new drugs. Jeremy was assigned as the BA for the project. After 
introducing himself and discussing the project in broad terms, Jeremy said to Ruth: “I ‘d like to talk with some of your 
chemists to understand their requirements for the system. Who might be good people to start with?”
Ruth replied:” I did that same job for five years before I became the division director three years ago. You do not really 
need to talk to any of my people. I can tell you everything you need to know about this project.” 
Jeremy was concerned. Scientific knowledge and technology change quickly, so he wasn’t sure if Ruth could adequately 
represent the current and future needs for users of this complex application. Perhaps there were some internal policies 
going on that weren’t apparent and there was a good reason for Ruth to create a buffer between Jeremy and the actual 
users. After some discussion, though, it became clear that Ruth didn’t want any her people involved directly with the 
project.
“OK,” Jeremy agreed reluctantly. “ May be I can start by doing some document analysis and bring questions I have to you. 
Can we set up a series of interviews for the next couple of weeks so I can understand the kinds of things you expect your 
scientists to be able to do t]with this new system?”
“Sorry I’m swamped right now,” Ruth told him. “I can give you a couple of hours in about three weeks to clarify things you 
are unsure about. Just go ahead and start writing the requirements. When we meet, then you can ask me any questions 
you still have, I hope that will let you get the ball rolling on the project.”
